## Display Handling

It's not easy to see the pattern in the character ROM, but it's there.

```
0x08 xx001000
0x14 xx010100
0x22 xx100010
0x22 xx100010
0x3E xx111110
0x22 xx100010
0x22 xx100010
0x00 xxxxxxxx
```

Apple II text mode : still uses 280x192 matrix.
Each character is 7 x 8 pixels.
280 / 7 = 40 columns.
192 / 8 = 24 rows.

Pixel size: Each character is made up of a 5x7 pixel bitmap, but displayed as a 7x8 character cell on the screen. there will be 1 pixel of padding on each side of the character.

Testing the TIGR library.

It looks like you do the following:
    create the display window.
    draw various things to the buffer.
    update the display.
So we can accumulate changes to the display memory/display buffer, and only update the display when we are ready to show it.
Say once each 1/60th of a second.
I guess we'll see how fast it is.
To start, update buffer every time we write to the screen.

well that sort of works! don't know if it's fast enough, but ok for now.

trying to boot actual apple 2 plus roms. Getting an infinite loop at f181 - 
this is testing how much memory by writing into every page. unfortunately everything
in the system right now is "ram" so it's never finding the end of ram ha ha.

OK that's fixed and it now boots to the keyboard loop! Though the prompt is missing, and there is no cursor because there
is no inverse or flash support right now.
Tigr doesn't look to be very flexible for keyboard input. It is very simple but may not do the trick.
Next one to try: SDL2: https://www.libsdl.org/

## Looking at SDL2

Downloaded source from:
https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.30.10

If you are building "the Unix way," we encourage you to use build-scripts/clang-fat.sh in the SDL source tree for your compiler:

mkdir build
cd build 
CC=/where/i/cloned/SDL/build-scripts/clang-fat.sh ../configure
make

the main GIT repo is version 3.0.
Lots of deprecations warnings, but it built.

Well, this is the easier way:

```
bazyar@Jawaids-MacBook-Pro gssquared % brew install sdl2
==> Auto-updating Homebrew...
Adjust how often this is run with HOMEBREW_AUTO_UPDATE_SECS or disable with
```

I'm going to go ahead and scrap the Tigr code because SDL2 looks like it will do the trick.

## Keyboard Logic

What better way to spend Christmas than writing an Apple II emulator?

SDL2 is better. I got the actual character ROM working. Looks pretty good.

Now working on the keyboard.

Currently keyboard code is inside the display code. This is not good.
SDL's use scope is broader than just the display. So we should move this out
into a more generalized module, that calls into display and keyboard 
and other 'devices' as needed.

OK, the SDL2 keyboard code is segregated out properly, and the keyboard code is working pretty well.

If a key has been pressed, its value is in the keyboard latch, 0xC000. The Bit 7 will be set if the strobe hasn't been cleared.
Clear the strobe by writing to 0xC010.

Looking at where I hook this in..

This is the SDL2 documentation for the keycodes:

https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_keycode.h



## Dec 25, 2024

I'm going to go ahead and scrap the Tigr code because SDL2 looks like it will do the trick.

For reference, the current design target is Apple II+ level.

I have some options for the next piece to tackle. Generally speaking, here is the project
status:

1. NMOS 6502 - (Complete.)
1. Keyboard - Complete. There may be tweaks needed.
1. 40-column text mode - Complete. Supports normal, inverse, and flash.

1. 40-column text mode - Screen 2. (Complete)
1. Low-resolution graphics - not started.
1. High-resolution graphics - not started.
1. Disk II Controller Card - Not started.
1. Sound - not started.
1. Printer / parallel port - not started.
1. Printer / serial port - not started.
1. Cassette - not started.
1. Joystick / paddles - not started.

Pretty much all of this is carried forward into the Apple IIe, IIc, and IIgs,
with the exception that the IIe non-enhanced uses 65n02, IIe enhanced uses 65c02, and IIc 
does also. Of course, the IIgs uses the 65816.

What is the best piece to tackle next? I think I'll work on the graphics modes. Not much I
can boot off a disk will do much without them.

## 40-column text mode - Screen 2

Poking 0xC055 will enable screen 2. It's still a 40-column text mode but it uses
memory at 0x0800-0x0BFF instead of 0x0400-0x07FF.

0xC054 will return to screen 1. These two flags affect text, lo-res, and hi-res graphics.

This should be a pretty easy piece to tackle.

We'll need:
   handlers to catch the accesses to 0xC054, 0xC055. When these are accessed we change
   the display buffer base address, and redraw the whole screen (only if the mode has changed).
   And we need to monitor for writes to the new display buffer base address.

This is where I want to implement the jump table for handling the 0xC000 - 0xC07F space.

### Low-resolution graphics

The low-resolution graphics are 40 x 48 blocks, 16 colors. Each nibble in a display page
byte represents a block. These will be 8 x 4 pixels in terms of the current display
buffer design. The color is one of a specific palette of 16 colors:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_graphics

### High-resolution graphics

Implemented in fake green-screen mode.

Bugs:
[ ] text line 21 does not update in mixed mode.


## Dec 26, 2024

Oddly, when I switch to screen 2, the display comes up. 
And when I write to 0x0800 with a character, it displays.
but it's not supposed to. txt_memory_write is not being called.
so it must be the flash handler. Try disabling that and see if the screen
doesn't update as expected.
if so, then the flash handler is updating too much.

Testing emulation speed.
Every 5 seconds, print the number of cycles since the last 5 seconds.
it's hovering around 1000000 cycles per second:

```
3747795 cycles
5194629 cycles
5233284 cycles
5287931 cycles
5082248 cycles
```

the low number was when generating tons of video display debug output.
I am running in the free-run mode, so slowness is not due to the clock sync emulation
let me turn off the display.
ok the display update is off, and it's in the same area. And it started at about 6M and worked its way down to 5.1.
it's pretty consistent..

```
5796507 cycles
6093662 cycles
5983934 cycles
5550091 cycles
5107896 cycles
5123350 cycles
5147278 cycles
5142563 cycles
5118742 cycles
5123895 cycles
```
am I sure I'm in free run ? I am.

SO. I was calling event_poll() every time through the instruction loop. So. Many. Times.
I put it inside the check for the display update, once every 1/60th second. This is per
docs that suggest "once per frame".

Removing that, I get a effective MHz speed of 150MHz, with optimizations -O3 enabled.
With -O0, I get about 61MHz effective, at free-run mode.
And of course I can turn off free mode.

I should implement some keyboard commands to toggle free-run mode. F9. That's convenient.
Maybe a key to toggle certain debug flags?

F9 works well. I should have it toggle between free-run, 1MHz, and 2.8MHz.

ok, that is working. I changed free-run from a flag, to a enum mode. So we can add other modes and even specify the exact mode.

This is a fun little program. Appleosft, and all text mode.
https://www.leucht.com/blog/2016/09/my-apple-iie-a-simple-text-based-arcade-game-in-applesoft-basic/
works just fine. All the scrolling causes the emulator to slow down to 3MHz effective rate.

It may end up being better to just draw the screen 60 times a second, and not worry about updating for every character. That feels weird, but, this
may be the modern way. 

ok let's think about this. 16 milliseconds per frame. 0.000087 seconds per scanline. (192 scanlines * 60 frames, 11520 scanlines per second).

I should only be copying the back buffer each frame, 16ms. this slows down to 1MHz:!
10 A=1
20 PRINT A
30 A = A + 1
40 GOTO 20

So something is wrong. This ought to FLY.

So let's try that other approach. Instead of updating the display for every character,
we'll just redraw the screen every 16ms. Will this be faster?

## Dec 27, 2024

Big performance drain on the video display.

Something that causes tons of scrolling:

795867523 cycles clock-mode: 0 cycles per second: 159.173508 MHz
796674469 cycles clock-mode: 0 cycles per second: 159.334900 MHz
218963831 cycles clock-mode: 0 cycles per second: 43.792767 MHz
5476743 cycles clock-mode: 0 cycles per second: 1.095349 MHz
5443788 cycles clock-mode: 0 cycles per second: 1.088758 MHz

Effective performance drops to 1MHz.

Sample shows:

we're doing tons of SDL related calls. They're probably fairly expensive ones.
I'll note that if we're doing a scroll, then we're reading every character on the screen (pure
memory copy is fast), but then writing every character on the screen - which generates a call to 
render_text for every character on the screen.
Render character is a loop in C that is 56 total iterations; so that's around 60K iterations of generating
the character bitmap.
Let's get rid of that inner loop by pre-generating the character bitmap.
Each Apple II character is 7x8 pixels. One bit per pixel.
The output we need to feed into SDL2 is 32-bit values, one per pixel.
So one character becomes 64 bytes, pre-coded. 

ok well that generated this:
5468271 cycles clock-mode: 0 cycles per second: 1.093654 MHz
5356073 cycles clock-mode: 0 cycles per second: 1.071215 MHz

basically no change.
I still have a loop. And while I unrolled it, I am still copying from main RAM to the texture.
So that's expensive.
Can I create a second texture that just contains the character bitmaps, and then copy chunks of
that to the screen?

ok look at row at a time.
txt_memory_write is called for each byte written.
currently it calculates row and column from the address.
Now, it will just calculate row, and mark the row as dirty.
on a screen update, we recalculate the dirty rows and render them.

Wow, holy cow. So what I implemented:
dirty line checker. (24 element array)
txt_memory_write is called for each byte written. But this now ONLY marks the line as dirty.
The actual rendering is done in update_display which is called every 16ms.
That scans the dirty line array. For each dirty line, it renders the line.
I can do 2000.7fff in the rom monitor - which dumps 28KBytes of memory.
It occurs virtually instantly.
This is because no matter how many characters are written to vram, the actual rendering
is of at most 24 lines, 60 times per second. So that limits the number of locks.
So, this could probably render all 24 lines at a time no matter what. I guess I should
try that because it would simplify flash mode etc. Flash wasn't hard at all - just
identify screen rows that have a flashing character, then mark the row as dirty. And
move the flash state to a global so it's accessible to the other routines.

### Apple III info:

For reference:
https://www.apple3.org/Documents/Magazines/AppleIIIExtendedAddressing.html

## Dec 28, 2024

The clock cycle emulation is a bit off. I am sleeping the calculated amount. But, at start of each cycle
we need to do:

When CPU is 'booted', we do this:
next_time = current_time + cycle_duration_ticks

do work

when we call "emulate_clock_cycle", we do this:
if (next_time < current_time) {
   clock_slip++;
   next_time = current_time + cycle_duration_ticks;
} else {
   sleep (next_time - current_time);
   next_time = next_time + cycle_duration_ticks;
}

The very first time through we'll likely have a big clock slip, which is fine. But we should
generally not have them otherwise.
I am currently sleeping for cycle_duration_ticks without taking into account the time it takes
to do the work.

Well, it's a little better. I'm hovering pretty close to 1.024 / 2.8mhz.

next: speaker, or lo-res graphics?

## Speaker

Let's look at the audio. This will not be fun.

https://discourse.libsdl.org/t/sdl-mixer-accuracy/25160
https://bumbershootsoft.wordpress.com/2016/09/05/making-music-on-the-apple-ii/

Each tweak of $C030 causes the speaker to pop in, or the speaker to pop out.
If we do the in and out 880 times per second, we'll get an A tone (440 hz)- though not a pleasing round one.
How do we convert this to a WAV file type stream?
a WAV file with a 440hzsquare wave in it, has 96 samples of $2000, followed by 96 samples of $E000.
These are UNSIGNED 16-bit samples. $8000 is 0 (neutral). $e000 is plus $6000, $2000 is minus $6000, i.e. 75% volume.

Presumably it will take a certain amount of time for the speaker cone to travel.
And once we stop pinging the speaker, it stops moving.
Maybe we can simulate that.
We keep track of a direction.
then generate pre-defined samples for predetermined time period.
Use signed samples.
Each hit on the C030 generates either positive samples, or negative samples.
these are added to the current buffer. E.g. if there was a positive, then they hit the
speaker again really fast, it will cancel out the first hit.
hitting it twice in a row one right after the other will cancel out the first completely.
Test this. YES. That is corect. I get a quiet sound, just like the article was saying.

So, we can test different waveforms to add into here. 
How long those waveforms are will determine the size of the buffer.
This will only work at lower virtual cpu speeds. Or, we can slow down the clock for N cycles after a
speaker hit, hoping that stays inside the sound loop. (or does apple iigs software change the timing for this?)
For now, assume 1MHz clock speed.

So the Apple II speaker is: a 1-bit DAC, where every other access is the inverse sign of the previous one.

We assume: a ramp-up time; a hold time; a ramp-down time. The ramp-up and ramp-down are probably very similar.
I don't know the hold time, but, we can try different values. And to go from negative to positive there
will be overall double the ramp time.

4 + 4 + 2 + 216 * (2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3) + 3 + 2 
   216 * (17) = 3672

my test code is xd8 (216) iterations at about 20 cycles each iteration, or, 3672 cycles.
An up and down is therefore 7360 cycles. at 1MHz, that is 138 per second. That doesn't sound right.

In any given cycle, if the speaker is hit, add the sample to the buffer at the time index.
The time index for the audio buffer is calculated in 1023000 cycles per second.

The waveform timing won't change with the clock speed, because it's a physical property of the speaker.

## Dec 29, 2024

ok. SDL_OpenAudioDevice is the function we need for audio streams. When you call it, you set a callback
function. SDL calls it whenever it needs more audio data. So we just need to buffer data to always have some for it.
If we ever don't have enough we'll have to send back 0's (or fill with whatever the last sample was), and this will be
perceived as a skip/glitch in the audio.

Start with a short standalone program. I will return a short square wave every X ms.

Hmm, there is another method. SDL can also do a push method. We call "QueueAudio periodically to feed it
more data. That is the model I was looking for originally. I like the callback model. It is asynchronous -
is it even multithreaded?

ok sample program audio.cpp is generating some blips.
Each time I am being asked for more data, I am sending 4096 samples. 4096 is 10.766 per second. That is awkward.
100 per second would be 441 samples. Try that. 
Yes, that's 100 per second - frame is 10ms. 

What is a reasonable time period I can use for buffering?
We don't want it to be too long, or there will be latency.

the AI says:
#### Summary of the Process

1. Intercept $C030 reads in the emulator:
   1. Toggle an internal speakerState.
   1. Record the time of the toggle as an event.
1. Accumulate toggles over emulated cycles.
1. Resample to the host’s audio rate (e.g., 44.1 kHz) by stepping through time or through the toggle events.
1. Write each sample as a 16-bit signed integer (e.g., +32767 for “high,” –32768 for “low,” or some scaled variant).
1. Feed that buffer to the host OS audio API in blocks (e.g., every 1/60 second or 1/100 second).

This is an interesting approach. however, if we just slammed on $C030 nonstop it would be a lot of memory?
no, only 1/60th of a second's worth. That is maybe on the order of 4262 samples. So a reasonable amount of memory.
Keep the events in a circular buffer.
Each event is just recording the number of cycles.
Each buffer records the current cycle index too.
So then we play through the buffer until we reach the current cycle index.
Each event is laid into our output audio buffer at the appropriate time index.
at 50000 samples per second, each sample is 20us. To simulate a 'tick', we would paint 10 samples
into the output buffer.

For testing, I can dump a time-series log of the events into a file, from inside
the emulator. Then analyze that data in a separate program. "Play it back". Easier to test.
have F8 start and stop the audio recording.

That's working. I can dump the events to a file.
Recording what happens just on a boot - I get exactly 192 events. That is one of those "ah ha"
numbers. 
11871
12402
12933
...
113292

etc.
Each of these is exactly 531 cycles apart.
101421 cycles total duration.
So about 1/10th second.

531 cycles is half the frequency. So, 1062 cycles is a full oscillation.
I read that as 963Hz.

I might be off on my cycle counts a bit. Something to look into.

OK, now let's write the playback code.
Let's generate a 1/60th second buffer each chunk - that will make us have about 6 chunks.
that is 735 samples per chunk.

I think in my math I was slightly off. This might be why:

https://mirrors.apple2.org.za/ground.icaen.uiowa.edu/MiscInfo/Empson/videocycles

```
> Or is the difference too small to be noticeable (hearable? What about
> processor loops that access  $c030? Could you hear a "background-humming"?

If you were trying to generate a precise tone, you would need to allow
for this when determining the number of CPU cycles between accesses to
$C030, i.e. work on the assumption that the CPU is executing uniform
cycles at 1.0205 MHz instead of 1.0227 MHz.
```

Some great resources Apple IIers posted in response to this:

## Dec 30, 2024

OK some of my cycle counts are off. There are no single-cycle instructions, but my
current implementation has all the flag instructions at 1 cycle for instance. So
that's wrong. Also PLA and RTS are 2 cycles too fast.
The following instructions in the beep loop are the wrong cycle counts:
SEC, PLA, RTS

After fixing these, I have 546 cycles between hits on $C030 instead of 531.
That is 2.82% slower through the loop, which should bring the tone down a hair.
However, now my beep is at 926Hz according to the spectrum analyzer.

The SA says the real apple II beep peak is at maybe 937Hz. 915-958 for the whole hump.
Reproduced is 872-969 with peak at 926Hz. Ah, so I need to bring that bottom end up a bit.
That difference is 1.17%, 1.2%.

In the recreation code I have one sample as 2.3us. That's wrong. They're 22.6us.
But I think there is an assumption that 1us = 1 cycle which is not quite right. It's 1% slow. And that's about how far
off we are, 1% low.

Grabbed the "Understanding the Apple II" books. I have some assumptions about clocking that are
not quite right. And would be incredibly hard to replicate. And are probably not the reason for
the differences.

### Audio update


I need to add the concept of an audio buffer.
Each 'event' I need to paint a BLIP worth of samples into the output audio stream. Currently this is 434 samples but it could be an arbitrary number. And, I need to ensure that ALL the samples that are part of a blip, get put into the output, even if they get painted beyond the current audio frame being requested via the sdl2 audio callback.

So, I need an intermediate buffer.

Weird, my speaker_event_log file had the wrong data in it?? Re-ran GS2 with a test of the 
beep routine, and now it's 546 cycles between events as I noted earlier. Weird.

now my "audio working" is too low. Way too low. I went the wrong way.

## Dec 31, 2024

So the audio callback cycle counter is running quite a bit faster than the cpu.
```
4568199 delta 24826466 cycles clock-mode: 2 CPS: 0.913640 MHz [ slips: 8739, busy: 24817727, sleep: 0]
audio_callback 35325884 35342835 0
```

I'm getting 300 audio frames per 5 seconds, that's correct, because I set it up at 60 frames per second.
in that same interval 5,166,383 cycles. 1033276.6 per second average.
But the audio clock ticked up from  25629912 to 30715212 or delta of 5085300.
That's a slight difference but does not account for the discrepancy of 10M cycles.

We want the audio cycle counter to run just behind the cpu cycle counter, such that the 
current cpu cycle count is always greater than the audio cycle count.
So if the audio cycle window count is > cpu_cycle_count, set

buf_start_cycle = cpu_cycle_count - cycles_per_buffer
buf_end_cycle = buf_start_cycle + cycles_per_buffer

see what that does.
We could store time markers as events in the event buffer, and have audio_callback continuously sync to that..

```
    if (buf_end_cycle > speaker_states[0].cpu->cycles) {
        std::cout << "audio cycle overrun resync from " << buf_end_cycle << " to " << speaker_states[0].cpu->cycles - CYCLES_PER_BUFFER << "\n";
        buf_start_cycle = speaker_states[0].cpu->cycles - CYCLES_PER_BUFFER;
        buf_end_cycle = buf_start_cycle + CYCLES_PER_BUFFER;
    } else if (buf_end_cycle < speaker_states[0].cpu->cycles - CYCLES_PER_BUFFER) {
        std::cout << "audio cycle underrunresync from " << buf_end_cycle << " to " << speaker_states[0].cpu->cycles - CYCLES_PER_BUFFER << "\n";
        buf_start_cycle = speaker_states[0].cpu->cycles - CYCLES_PER_BUFFER;
        buf_end_cycle = buf_start_cycle + CYCLES_PER_BUFFER;
    } else {
```

OK, that is keeping it synced, however, I'm getting a lot of overruns and underruns and audio artifacts.
But, the window is staying aligned to the CPU cycle count and I am not getting into situations where
the audio is lagging.

My alternative here is to push audio stream, instead of having SDL2 pull it.

I made a loader function - passing -a filename will load a file into RAM at 0x0801, assuming applesoft basic.
That let me load Lemonade Stand. he he. Lots of sound in there, really shows the issue with audio sync.

I have added some extra 'guardrails' around the buffering, and I improved results and reduced underrun and overrun. But I'm still not entirely happy with the results. I'm going to have to just grind out some hard thinking on it.

And, it definitely only works in 1MHz. Actually, let's see what insanity ensues at free-run..
(I'm wondering if I can try syncing not to hard-set 1.0205 but to whatever the specified clock speed is)
Ah, at 2.8 it's sort of legible but super fast. And at free run the entire segment plays a short tone and then
skips to the next screen in under a second, lol.

https://github.com/kurtjd/rust-apple2/blob/main/src/sound.rs

This is an apple 2 emulator written in Rust, and this is the sound code.

** ok, well now. I took out the display optimization. effective cycles per second is 1.01xxxmhz. I think the audio is working better.
[ ] So it's due to the cpu clock running slightly faster than the audio timing.


## Lo-Res Graphics

Let's do a sprint to get LORES:

## Cassette Interface

On the one hand this seems silly. On the other hand, it is vintage cool, and there are actually web sites that distribute audio streams of old games stored in audio files, that you can play into an Apple II.

https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/143/what-format-is-used-for-apple-ii-cassette-tapes

The Apple II recorded data as a frequency-modulated sine wave. A standard consumer cassette deck could be connected to the dedicated cassette port on the Apple ][, ][+, and //e. The //c, ///, and IIgs did not have this port.

A tape could hold one or more chunks of data, each of which had the following structure:

Entry tone: 10.6 seconds of 770Hz (8192 cycles at 1300 usec/cycle). This let the human operator know that the start of data had been found.
Tape-in edge: 1/2 cycle at 400 usec/cycle, followed by 1/2 cycle at 500 usec/cycle. This "short zero" indicated the transition between header and data.
Data: one cycle per bit, using 500 usec/cycle for 0 and 1000 usec/cycle for 1.
There is no "end of data" indication, so it's up to the reader to specify the length of data. The last byte of data is followed by an XOR checksum, initialized to $FF, that can be used to check for success.

For machine-language programs, the length is specified on the monitor command line, e.g. 800.1FFFR would read $1800 (6144) bytes. For BASIC programs and data, the length is included in an initial header section:

 * Integer BASIC programs have a two-byte (little-endian) length.
 * Applesoft BASIC has a two-byte length, followed by a "run" flag byte.
 * Applesoft shape tables (loaded with SHLOAD) have a two-byte length.
 * Applesoft arrays (loaded with RECALL) have a three-byte header.
Note the header section is a full data area, complete with 10.6-second lead-in.

The storage density varies from 2000bps for a file full of 0 bits to 1000bps for a file full of 1 bits. Assuming an equal distribution of bits, you can expect to transfer about 187 bytes/second (ignoring the header).

An annotated 6502 assembly listing, as well as C++ code for deciphering cassette data in WAV files, can be found here. The code in the system monitor that reads and writes data is less then 200 bytes long.


## Pascal Firmware Protocol

The Pascal protocol seems to be geared towards I/O, like serial devices, and displays.
However, there are "device class" assignments for :
Printer, Joystick, Serial/parallel, modem, sound/speech device, clock, mass-storage, 80 column card, network or bus interface, special purpose, and reserved.

Unclear how widely-supported this is.

## Generic Disk Interface - proposed

### Registers

Propose:

```
C0S0 - lo byte of sector number
C0S1 - hi byte of sector number
C0S2 - target address lo byte
C0S3 - target address hi byte
C0S4 - sector count
C0S5 - command. 0x1A = read, 2C = write.
```

Someone could easily accidentally write garbage to the disk by strafing these registers. Give some thought
on how to prevent that... Have the commands be values unlikely to be written by accident.
Require a specific double-strobe. Something like that.
Ah. Write values in. Strobe. Write command. Strobe.
if not done in this sequence, command is ignored.
Then the data is DMA'd into memory.

### Firmware
$CS00 - boot.
$CS??


## Disk II Interface

First, ROMs:

https://mirrors.apple2.org.za/ftp.apple.asimov.net/emulators/rom_images/

   * $C0S0 - Phase 0 Off
   * $C0S1 - Phase 0 On
   * $C0S2 - Phase 1 Off
   * $C0S3 - Phase 1 On
   * $C0S4 - Phase 2 Off
   * $C0S5 - Phase 2 On
   * $C0S6 - Phase 3 Off
   * $C0S7 - Phase 3 On
   * $C0S8 - Turn Motor Off
   * $C0S9 - Turn Motor On
   * $C0SA - Select Drive 1
   * $C0SB - Select Drive 2
   * $C0SC - Q6L
   * $C0SD - Q6H
   * $C0SE - Q7L
   * $C0SF - Q7H

So, the idea I have for this:
each Disk II track is 4kbyte. I can build a complex state machine to run when
$C0xx is referenced. Or, when loading a disk image, I can convert the disk image
into a pre-encoded format that is stored in RAM. Then we just play this back very
simply, in a circle. The $C0xx handler is a simple state machine, keeping track
of these values:
   * Current track position. track number, and phase.
   * Current read/write pointer into the track
   

Each pre-encoded track will be a fixed number of bytes.

If we write to a track, we need to know which sector, so we can update the image
file on the real disk.

Done this way, the disk ought to be emulatable at any emulated MHz speed. Our 
pretend disk spins faster along with the cpu clock! Ha ha.

### Track Encoding

At least 5 all-1's bytes in a row.

Followed by :

```
Mark Bytes for Address Field: D5 AA 96
Mark Bytes for Data Field: D5 AA AD
```

### Head Movement

to step in a track from an even numbered track (e.g. track 0):
```
LDA C0S3        # turn on phase 1
(wait 11.5ms)
LDA C0S5        # turn on phase 2
(wait 0.1ms)
LDA C0S4        # turn off phase 1
(wait 36.6 msec)
LDA C0S6        # turn off phase 2
```

Moving phases 0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3 etc moves the head inward towards center.
Going 3,2,1,0,3,2,1,0 etc moves the head inward.
Even tracks are positioned under phase 0,
Odd tracks are positioned under phase 2.

If track is 0, and we get:
Ph 1 on, Ph 2 on, Ph 1 off
Then we move in one track to track. 1.

So we'll want to debug with printing the track number and phase.

When software is syncing, it's just going to look for 5 FF bytes in a row
from the read register, followed by the marks. That's basically it.
For handling writing, we might want to have each sector in its own block and up
to a certain 

We'll be able to handle both 6-and-2 and 5-and-3 scheme in case anyone wants this -
it would be registering a different disk ii handler that would set a flag.
In theory this scheme could let you nibble-copy disk images too.

The media is traveling faster under the head when the head is at the edge;
slower when under the center. The time for a track to pass under the head is
the same regardless of which track the head is over. In the physical world,
this means the magnetic pulses are physically longer when the head is at the edge.
In our emulated world, it should be roughly the same number of bits per ms
regardless of position. So each track should be the same number of pre-encoded bytes.

If the motor is off, we stop rotating bits out through the registers.

OK, we have a 6:2 encoding table.

## Apple IIe Dinking

I implemented some infrastructure to automatically fetch and combine ROMs from the Internet
for use by the emulator.

The Apple IIe ROMs aren't working, because we don't have correct memory mapping in place
for the ROMs.

Apple IIe Technical Reference Manual, Pages 142-143, cover this, but it's dense and the diagram
doesn't exactly match the text.

Booting up, we see this (we didn't get very far, lol):
```

```
 So, it's trying to enable "Internal ROM at $CX00" when it hits $C007:

 "When SLOTCXROM is active (high), the IO memory space from $C100 to $C7FF is allocated
 to the expansion slots, as described previously. Setting SLOTCXROM inactive (low) disables
 the peripheral-card ROM and selects built-in ROM in all of the I/O memory space
 except the part from $C000 to $C0FF (used for soft switches and data I/O).
 In addition to the 80 col firmware at $C300 and $C800, the built-in ROM
 includes firmware that performs the self-test of the Apple IIe's hardware.

So it's trying to enable the internal ROM. Which I have loaded, but I am not exposing that
part of the memory page.

This brings up the question of whether page sizes should be 4K as I was originally thinking,
or 256 bytes. There's a bunch of stuff here that gets paged in on 256 byte boundaries.
I guess I could add some logic to bus.c to try to handle this.

Should review all the 80-column stuff too. Might as well jump in and document all the "extra
memory bank" related stuff, and go straight from where we're at with 64K, to 128K.


## Apple II (non-plus) dinking

Going the other direction, loading Apple II (original) f/w on the emulator works.
Dumps you into monitor ROM, and, ctrl-B into Integer BASIC!

F666G puts you into the mini-assembler, which is especially fun.

This is an Integer basic game :

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_BASIC

that would be a pain in the ass to type in, so, was thinking about a copy/paste feature
to paste data into the emulator.

Since I've started this Platform work, there are some things to think about:

1. Even to support full Apple IIe functionality, we're going to need the ability to handle more than
64K of memory. This is done with switches, and the 'bus' is still only 16 bit.
1. The Platform concept should include selection of the CPU chip, and perhaps certain hardware. Though
we probably want to have some separation so we can have "Any card in any platform in any slot".



# January 2, 2025

I have an interesting concept, of extensive use of function pointers in structs / arrays.
For example, when defining the Apple II Plus platform, we would have a struct that
is a list of all the devices that need to be initialized. They would be executed in order.
A different platform could have a different set.
All the devices would interface specifically through the Bus concept - just like they do in the
real systems, and, must not have any cross-dependencies. And then all the devices
code could be 100% shared between different platform definitions.
A device class would be composed of:
  initialization method
  de-initialization method

They tie into the system through:
  bus_register
  bus_unregister
  timer_register
  timer_unregister

timer_register is something that's hardcoded in the gs2 main loop right now.
But we could maintain a ordered event queue of function pointers to call.
Let's say we've got video routines 60 times a second; and another thing that needs to
happen 10 times a second, etc. Each time a handler ran, it would reschedule itself
for a next run, as appropriate.

To integrate into SDL events, build a data structure that would have callbacks based on certain event types.

This is a goal, before we get too awful many devices into this thing.

At a little higher level, we'll have a slot device class. These will be called with a slot number.
And then register themselves into the system as appropriate.

## January 3, 2025

Thinking about display a little bit.
We're going to need to have the native display be 560x192 pixels. This is for a few reasons.
1) handle 80 column text. that's 7 pixels x 80 = 560.
2) handle double hi-res. This is 560x192.
3) even with standard hi-res, if we want to simulate the slight horizontal displacement of different color pixels, then
we need to have 560 pixels horizontally. This actually sort of simplifies HGR display.

The implication is that either I change the texture scale horizontally by a factor of 2
(e.g., in 40-column modes it would be 8x 4y scaling), or, I can just write twice
as many pixels horizontally to the texture.

Yes. We would still define the texture as 560x192.
In 40-col text and regular lo-res mode, we would only write pixels into 280x192, and SDL_RenderCopy 
double (see below) to stretch it.
In 80-col mode, double lo-res mode, and hi-res mode, and double hi-res mode, we would write pixels into 560x192
and copy w/o stretching.

This implies we need to keep the screen mode per line. i.e. each of the 24 lines would be:
   lores40
   lores80
   text40
   text80
   hires
   dhires

The display overall would also have a color vs monochrome mode.
And we need to keep track of the "color-killer" mode: in mixed text and graphics mode, the text is color-fringed. In pure text mode, the display is set to only display white pixels. Actually this implies that even on lines in text mode, we might need to draw the text with the slight pixel-shift and color-fringed effect. In which case, all buffers would always be 560 wide. And, we would likely post-process the color-fringe effect. I.e., draw a scanline (or, 8 scanlines), then apply filtering to color the bits. Then render.

In monochrome mode, a pixel is just on or off. no color. But, probably still pixel-shifted.

Depending on how intricate this all gets, we may even need to use a large pixel resolution than 560x192. Would have to read up on the Apple II NTSC stuff in more detail.

```
// Source rectangle (original dimensions)
    SDL_Rect srcRect = {
        0,      // X position
        y * 8,  // Y position
        280,    // Original width
        8       // Height
    };

    // Destination rectangle (stretched dimensions)
    SDL_Rect dstRect = {
        0,      // X position
        y * 8,  // Y position
        560,    // Doubled width (or whatever scale you want)
        8       // Height
    };

    SDL_RenderCopy(renderer, texture, &srcRect, &dstRect);
```

Example hires bytes:

  01010101 - 55. Purple dots. even byte (0,2,etc)
  00101010 - 2A. Purple dots. odd byte. (1,3,etc)

  11010101 - D5. Blue dots. even byte (0,2,etc)
  10101010 - AA. Blue dots. odd byte. (1,3,etc)

Apple2TS does not do color fringing on text. 

A very thorough hires renderer:

## Jan 4, 2025

The DiskII code is now correctly generating a nibblized disk image in memory.
I have tested this two ways, first, by comparing encoded sectors to the example
in decodeSector.py. Second, by taking an entire disk and inspecting it with 
CiderPress2. This has the ability to read nibblized disk images and pull data
out of them, catalog them, etc. Slick.

Getting ready to write the read register support, then, we ought to be able to
boot a bloody DOS 3.3 image!

In preparation for that, I took the code I was working on which was a separate
set of source files and executable, and moved it into a new folder structure,
src/devices/diskii. There is also apps/nibblizer. There's a hierarchy of Makes
and Cmake apparently makes it very easy to turn some of these into libraries
and link them into the main executable. This means the diskii_fmt files are now
shared between the main executable and the nibblizer executable. Slick.

I also have had some thoughts about how to do runtime configuration and linking of
a user interface with the engine. I was thinking, some kind of IPC mechanism.
If we use web tech like JSON to an API, that could open up some very interesting
possibilies. It would allow remote control over the internet; it would allow 
programmatic / scripted runtime configuration of the system, which could really
help automate testing. This could work kind of like the bittorrent client,
where the configurator is just a web app.

[ ] DiskII should get volume byte from DOS33 VTOC and 'format' the disk image with it.

[ ] Create struct configuration tables for memory map for each platform.

[ ] There's an obvious optimization in the DiskII area - we don't have to shift the bits out of the register. We can just provide the full byte with the hi-bit set. This would 
probably work and speed up disk emulation mightily.

## Jan 5, 2025

Well as of this morning I'm booting disk images!

However, they are exceptionally slow operating. I think it must have to do with the interleaving.
I am laying them out in memory in logical disk order, but with the sector numbers mapped
to interleave. I think that's insufficient.

Check out my CiderPress2 generated .nib image and see what order the sectors are in.

yeah, physical sectors numbers in the CP2 image are: 0, 1, etc. So not only do they change the sector numbers
in the address field, but, we need to reorder the data so the physical sectors in the stream are in the physical sector order:
i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.

original way

gs2 -d testdev/disk2/disk_sample.do  50.24s user 0.40s system 98% cpu 51.397 total

new way (physical order)

gs2 -d testdev/disk2/disk_sample.do  47.40s user 0.35s system 99% cpu 48.173 total

That's not much difference - 3 seconds.

Here's some more potential stuff:

From Understanding the Apple II. page 9-37:
"Is is possible to check whether a drive at a slot is on by configuring for reading
data and monitoring the data register. If a drive is turned on, the data register will
be changing and vice-versa."

So when the disk is off, it is turning it on and waiting a second for it to spin up.

Understanding the Apple II. page 9-13: "The effect of this timer is to
delay drive turn-off until one second after a reference to $C088,X".

So I need to emulate the timer. Each iteration through the DiskII code, check
cpu cycles from "mark_cycles_turnoff". if it's non-zero, then see if it's
been one second. Only then mark the motor disabled. On a reset the delay timer
is cleared and drive turned off almost immediately."

So, simulate this timer. Because I think the II is waiting one second every time it
turns the disk motor on.

We will need a "list of routines to call on a reset" queue. Disk:
"RESET forces all disk switches to off, and clears the delay timer."

There is also this: "Access to even addresses causes the data register contents to be
transferred to thedata bus."

my attempt to delay motor off is not working, its causing the disk to chugga chugga.
Don't forget I'm starting on track 13 every time to be silly. Would help a little
to have it start at track 0.

None of this has really helped. here's what I'm thinking. say I'm in an apple ii.
I read a sector. I have to go off and do stuff with it.
by the time I come back to read the next sector, the disk has spun around a circle
for a while. But my emulator hasn't moved the virtual head. So all this interleave 
stuff is just wrong. 

I need to simulate the disk continuing to spin while we're away. So, between reads
from the disk, I need to spin the disk that many nybbles.

Never mind. I disabled my "accelerator" and now it boots fast. That code was causing a big
mismatch between the simulated disk and cycles going by - it was messing with the interleave
timing.

Now we're at 11 seconds!

This may yet be an issue when writing. Have to take a look at the write code in DOS.
And, of course, we'll need a denibblizer routine. I bet I can steal that from Woz too!

A ton of software requires 64K. So I guess that's the next thing to do.

I am thinking, a more generalized event queue is needed. For instance, the disk needs to turn
off one second after the command to turn it off is actually sent. Right now I am cheating
and checking cpu cycles but only when the disk registers are read. Software is going to want
to turn it off and then NOT READ REGISTERS for a while.

Of course I also have timing routines related to video and audio. So that's where the event queue
comes in. It needs to be -ordered-, when we read out of it.

It's going to be the following:
cycle count to trigger at
function pointer to call
argument 1 uint64_t
argument 2 uint64_t

This will be part of the CPU struct, so the actual function can be called with the CPU pointer.

[ ] Add 'Language card' / 64K support.
[ ] Add event queue system.
[ ] Add Disk II write support.
[ ] Add .nib and .po format support.
[ ] Note infinite loop on the console, but do not terminate.


### Language Card:

4K RAM Bank 1: D000 - DFFF
4K RAM Bank 2: D000 - DFFF

10K RAM: E000 - F7FF
2K RAM: F800 - FFFF
Language ROM: F800 - FFFF

So thinking about 256 byte memory map. In the IIe like the stack page can be swapped
between main and aux memory.

So, 64K memory map is 256 pages of 256 bytes. Create memory table with 256 byte pages.

For GS, we could have a multi-level memory map that lets us have two different page sizes. An extension to do
later.

Separately allocate the actual memory areas and assign them to variables that exist independently of the memory map.
Because we will need to swap these in and out.

So for instance, for the II+ we'll do:
  * Main_RAM = alloc(48K)
  * Main_IO = alloc(4k)
  * Main_ROM = alloc(12K)

The pages do not have to be allocated separately. Contigious is fine.

Then assign subsets of these to the memory map in 256 byte increments. 

For language card, we'll have:
  * Bank_RAM_4K_1 = alloc(4K)
  * Bank_RAM_4K_2 = alloc(4K)
  * Bank_RAM_6K = alloc(6K)
  * Bank_RAM_2K = alloc(2K)
  * Bank_ROM = alloc(2K)

And then memory map altered when softswitches are toggled appropriately.
We will want some external functions to mediate this, in bus.cpp.
It seems straightforward how a card would swap its pages in. How would we swap back? Does it save the old entries? hm, yes, I think it does. On init_card, it will save the memory map entries that were present at init time. 
  * OR, 3rd: store the main system memory blocks into well-known variable names.

ok I'm gonna cut for the night - I have the new memory map implemented, and have gs2 booting again. I think the language card hooks are in, and now need to start testing that.

I ended up allocating all in one big 64K chunk. That's more like the real thing and is less to keep track of.

## Jan 6, 2025

Some of the memory management might be a lot easier if I think about it this way:
instead of allocating all these different chunks, do:
  * 1 64KByte chunk for RAM.
  * 1 12KB chunk for ROM.

Then I map the effective address space into the appropriate bits of these chunks.
E.g.:

1st 48K is mapped straight.
```
Then D000 bank 1 => RAM[0xC000]
D000 bank 2 => RAM[0xD000]
```

Also this is more likely closer to how the apple IIe does it - there aren't all
these separate RAM chips. they just had a 64K bank of RAM. This is because the same
patterns apply to aux memory (the additional 64K chunk there.) Then we can just have
aux memory be treated the same way.

OK, running the Apple II Diagnostic disk. I have C083 * 2 'good', C083 'bad'. I think this
is because the manual says we are supposed to read C083 TWICE to switch into RAM/RAM read/write
mode. What constitutes reading twice in a row? This is almost certainly some protection against
accidental reads of C083.

The first time C083 is hit, it's the same as hitting C080 - ram read, no writing. Hitting C083 a second time enables writing to RAM.

ok, it passes the diagnostic test now!!!

Trying to boot ProDOS - I got the ProDOS boot screen and blip!
but infinite loop doing this:
```
Thunderclock Plus read register C090 => 00
Thunderclock Plus read register C090 => 00
Thunderclock Plus read register C090 => 00
Thunderclock Plus read register C090 => 00
```
turned that off..
now fails here:
```
schedule motor off at 15126338 (is now 14376338)
languagecard_read_C08B - LANG_RAM_BANK1 | RAM_RAM
bank_number: 1, reads: 1, writes: 0
page: D0 read: 0x148014000 write: 0x14700ae00 canwrite: 0
...
languagecard_read_C08B - LANG_RAM_BANK1 | RAM_RAM
bank_number: 1, reads: 1, writes: 1
page: D0 read: 0x148014000 write: 0x148014000 canwrite: 1
...
Unknown opcode: FD6F: 0x82CPU halted: 1
```

it's running from ram.

So it's loaded code into page D6 and then hit invalid opcode 0x82.
When we hit the system halt, I should be able to dump memory and various things.



Hm, this could be a disk order thing.. maybe I can check bytes in the image to detect if it's DOS 3.3 or ProDOS and implement the correct interleave? doesn't seem likely..

In the debug prints, display the buffers in more informative way. Instead of raw pointer, say "main_ram(DE)" to specify main_ram page DE. Make a little subroutine for it.

Carmen Sandiego got a little bit further. Wants me to put in disk 2. now what?! hehe.

I don't think hires page 2 is working.. Hm, no, it is.

Something is still not quite working with the memory map stuff.

OK, Thunderclock utils disk downloaded. These things want "thunderclock plus firmware" to be present to work. 

I should also be able to freeze execution any other time and do the same.
And disassemble code. So, I need a system monitor app.
I could do a running disassembly, i.e. have the last 10 or 20 instructions in a circular buffer,
dumped also.


So, various things are trying to load Integer basic, but then failing to do so. There is some sort of test that's being done that fails, for if there is a language card present. The first thing I note, is that this hits:

C081, then C081 again 4 cycles later. and Apple IIe manual has "RR" next to C081. I think all the modes that enable RAM writes, require the double-read in order to turn on RAM writes. Let's go ahead and try that.

Apparently Locksmith 6.0 has a "really good language card tester".

Apple2ts , when it hits C08B once, switches immediately to R/W RAM Bank 1 for D0 - FF. That is not what the manual says. Maybe the manual is wrong.
also, when it hits C081, I can wait a very long time before hitting again and then it switches to read rom write ram.
and then C08B switches immediately to RW RAM Bank 1. wut.
c081 c08b goes to rw ram bank 1.
c089 by itself does nothing. again does read rom write ram.
So the 2nd read doesn't have to be the same switch. It can be any of the other double switches.
and C08b and c083 go immediately to read ram.
(They also trigger c100-c7ff / and c800-cfff 'peripheral' instead of 'internal ROM', which must be an Apple IIe thing.)


Notes from apple2ts

```
  // All addresses from $C000-C00F will read the keyboard and keystrobe
  // R/W to $C010 or any write to $C011-$C01F will clear the keyboard strobe

  if (addr >= 0xC080 && addr <= 0xC08F) {
    // $C084...87 --> $C080...83, $C08C...8F --> $C088...8B
    handleBankedRAM(addr & ~4, calledFromMemSet)
    return
```

There appears to be an extensive discussion of this stuff in Understanding the Apple II.
Chapter 5, page 5-26, The 16K RAM CARD

ok, going by this, my implementation is wrong, and misses the effect writes can have. This
was not documented by Apple. Bad Apple.

Sather discusses a number of flip-flops (state bits):
Bank_1 flip flop. 0 = bank 2, 1 = bank 1.
Read_Enable flip flop. 1 = enable read from expansion RAM. 0 = enable read from ROM.
Write_Enable' flip flop. 0 = enable write to expansion RAM. 1 = no write.
Pre_Write flip flop.

the write flip flops can be thought of as a write counter which counts odd read accesses
in the C08X range. The counter is set to zero by even or write access in the C08X range.
If the write counter reaches the count of 2, writing to expansion RAM is enabled.
Writing will stay enabled until an even access is made in the C08X range.

```
at power on:
Bank_1 = 0
Pre_Write = 0
Read_Enable = 0
Write_Enable' = 0 ()
 - says Reset has no effect. I bet they changed this.

A3
= 0, C080-C087 - any access resets Bank_1. 
= 1, C088-C08F - any access sets Bank_1.

A0/A1
==00, 11 : C080, C083, C084, C087, C088, C08B, C08C, C08F - set READ_ENABLE.
==01, 10 : C081, C082, C085, C086, C089, C08A, C08D, C08E - reset READ_ENABLE.

PRE_Write = 1
then can reset WRITE_ENABLE'
```

Pre_Write is set by Odd Read Access in C08X range.
Pre_Write is reset of Even access in range, OR a write access anywhere in C08X range.

WRITE_ENABLE' is reset by an odd read access in C08X when PRE_Write is 1.
WRITE_ENABLE' is set by an even access in C08X range.

So, Bank and Read enable are set on both reads and writes. That was not at all clear.

**I can now successfully boot ProDOS 1.1.1. I can load integer basic on the DOS3.3 master disk.**

## Jan 7, 2025

The JACE (java) emulator has a working Thunderclock implementation, including the thunderclock ROM file.
That's probably what I need to check to fix my implementation.

Looking at generic ProDOS clock implementation.

ProDOS recognizes a clock card if:
```
Cn00 = $08
Cn02 = $28
Cn04 = $58
Cn06 = $70
Cn08 - READ entry point
Cn0B - WRITE entry point
```

The ProDOS routine stores date and time in:
```
$BF91 - $BF90
day: bits 4-0
month: bits 8-5
year: bits 15-9
$BF93 - hour
$BF92 - minute
```

The ProDOS clock driver expects the clock card to send an ASCII
string to the GETLN input buffer ($200). This string must have the
following format (including the commas):
  * mo,da,dt,hr,mn
  * mo is the month (01 = January...12 = December)
  * da is the day of the week (00 = Sunday...06 = Saturday)
  * dt is the date (00 through 31)
  * hr is the hour (00 through 23)
  * mn is the minute (00 through 59)

It doesn't say but presumably the $200 getln ends with a carriage return.

Well this seems very simple. The only question is, how do we trigger a call
into a native routine?
CPU is going to do this:
JSR $Cn08
Cn08: XX YY ZZ
What values can we put there we can capture?
Options.
1) write our own ASM firmware that runs in Cn00. This will read registers.
2) some other option I forgot.

Ah ha! 6.3 of ProDOS-8-Tech-Ref is Disk Driver Routines. Same conversation regarding
"3rd party disk drives".

```
$Cn01 = $20
$Cn03 = $00
$Cn05 = $03
```

if $CnFF = $00, ProDOS assumes a 16-sector Disk II card.
If $CnFF = $FF, ProDOS assumes a 13-sector Disk II card.
If $CnFF <> $00 or $FF, assumes has found an intelligent disk controller.
If Status byte at $CnFE indicates it supports READ and STATUS requests,
ProDOS marks the global page with a device driver whose high-byte is
$Cn and low-byte is $CnFF.
E.g., in Slot 5, that would be $C5<value of $CnFF>. Let's say $CnFF was
23. Then ProDOS would record a device driver address at $C523.

This is the boot code.

So the start of the device driver is:
```
C700    LDX #$20
C702    LDA #$00
C704    LDX #$03
C706    LDA #$00
C708    BIT $CFFF - turn off other device ROM in c8-cf
C70B    LDA #$01
C70D    STA $42
C70F    LDA #$4C
C711    STA $07FD
C714    LDA #$C0
C716    STA $07FE
C719    LDA #$60
C71B    STA $07FF
C71E    JSR $07FF     ; call an RTS to get our page number
C721    TSX
C722    LDA $0100,X
C725    STA $07FF     ; finish writing instruction JMP $Cn60 to $7FD
C728    ASL
C729    ASL
C72A    ASL
C72B    ASL
C72C    STA $43
C72E    LDA #$08
C730    STA $45
C732    LDA #$00
C734    STA $44
C736    STA $46
C738    STA $47
C73A    JSR $07FD
C73D    BCS C75D  - if carry set, error
C73F    LDA #$0A
C741    STA $45
C743    LDA #$01
C745    STA $46
C747    JSR $07FD
C74A    BCS $c75D - if carry set, error
C74C    LDA $0801
C74F    BEQ $C75D - if zero, error
C751    LDA #$01
C753    CMP $0800
C756    BNE $C75D - if not equal, error.
C758    LDX $43
C75A    JMP $0801 - proceed with boot.
C75D    JMP $E000 - jump into basic (or something)
```

So when a JSR to $Cn60 is made, the Apple2TS emulator does its pretend
call. Here it's full of BRK, so, it's not actually executing anything.

Disk driver calls are: STATUS, READ, WRITE, FORMAT.
STATUS
   checks if device is ready for a read or write. If not, set carry,
   and return error in A.

   If ready, clear carry, set A = $00, and return the number of blocks
   on the device in X (low byte) and Y (high byte).

```
DEVICE numbers (physical slot 5)
  S5,D1 = $50
  S5,D2 = $D0
  S1, D1 = $10
  S1, D2 = $90

DEVICE numbers (physical slot 5)
  S6,D1 = $60
  S6,D2 = $E0
  S2, D1 = $20
  S2, D2 = $A0
```

  What are return vlaues for read and write?

Device number is ( (Slot + (D-1)) * 0x10  )

```
Special locations in ROM:
$CnFC - $CnFD - total number of blocks on device
$CnFE - Status byte
  bit 7 - medium is removable
  bit 6 - device is interruptable
  bit 5-4 - number of volumes on device (0-3)
  bit 3 - device supports formatting
  bit 2 - device can be written to
  bit 1 - device can be read from
  bit 0 - device's status can be read (must be 1)
$CnFF - low byte of entry to driver routines
```

Ah, so this lets us do CDROMs and stuff (read-only, removable).

```
Call Parameters: - Zero Page

$42 - Command: 0 = STATUS, 1 = READ, 2 = WRITE, 3 = FORMAT
$43 - Unit number. 
  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
|DR|  SLOT  | NOT USED  |
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
DR = Disk Read
SLOT = Slot number

$44-$45 - buffer pointer. (Start of 512 memory buffer for data transfer)
$46-$47 - Block number - block on disk for data transfer.
Error codes:
$00 - no error
$27 - I/O error
$28 - No device connected
$2B - write protected
```
So, one method to handle this would be to do this:
when we're about to enter the execution loop, if the PC
is $Cn60, or, one of a list of other registered addresses)
then we can call our special handler.
Which needs to do the following:
  * execute
  * pretend to do an RTS

OK this is exactly what Apple2ts does, and it seems reasonable. And it will
be lightning fast.

So, we can implement:
  * ProDOS Disk II Drive Controller (280 max blocks)
  * ProDOS 800k Drive Controller (1600 max blocks)
  * ProDOS Hard Disk Controller ($FFFF max blocks)
I recommend we flush write on every write.
The extended commands for SmartPort would let us do multiple blocks at once,
improving performance there.

ok, I need byte Cn07 to be set to $3C. $00 means "smartport", which I'm not supporting yet. This disk
I have wants a //e or //c. So let's find another image.

Holy grail! I am booting ProDOS 1.1.1 off 800k "disk" media and the ProDOS block driver is working!

ok, tomorrow, implement writing, it should be a nearly trivial addition.

NO DO IT NOW.

## January 9, 2025

So I have this idea for how to handle the infinite loop detection - the 65c02 (or maybe just 816) implemented
an instruction called WAI, that halted processing until an interrupt occurred. So we can do that when we hit an infinite
loop case - trigger a WAI state - this will then not run CPU instructions, but, will still do the other
event loop stuff, and, will sleep for 1/60th of a second at a time, letting the cpu rest.
infinite loops are not that unusual an occurence on old software. Seems reasonable.

I am working on pushing the media_descriptor stuff down into the hardware layer as far as makes sense.
This way there is only one place where media is updated.
Also, we can have a single place in the main loop and/or exit, where we can "unmount" and safely write
media to real disk.

I need to find a variety of 2mg images to test:
  * dos 3.3 image
  * prodos 143k image
  * prodos 800k image
  * hard disk drive image

## January 10, 2025

I have a cool idea. Set up a web site that mirrors the various image sites.
Provide a search engine that lets you search for images by name, description,
or, by the various attributes, AND BY file contents on the files inside the images!
And quickly browse the image contents (catalog), and, view the files inside. Could
use cp2 behind the scenes since it already knows all the image and file formats.
This would be handy for calaloguing my own stuff.

For later reference: Apple III hardware description:

https://ftp.apple.asimov.net/documentation/apple3/A3SOSReferenceVol.1.pdf

Everything seems straightforward except:
"Extended/enhanced indirect addressing"
https://www.apple3.org/Documents/Magazines/AppleIIIExtendedAddressing.html
also discussed in detail in 2.4.2.2 in the A3 SOS Reference above.

Huge amount of Apple /// info here: https://ftp.apple.asimov.net/documentation/apple3/

There are great disassemblies of Apple III SOS and probably ROM. These can be used to 
answer questions about the hardware.

Apple III disk image formats:
https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/12684/what-are-the-most-common-apple-ii-disk-image-formats-and-what-hardware-disk-driv

A whole bunch of Apple III software:
https://www.apple3.org/iiisoftware.html

I started thinking about other Apple II+ things need to be done; 
  * color hi-res.
  * shift-key mod. (Should be super simple, but need software to test).

Shift-key mod. Basically, if shift was pressed with key, then mark PB2 high. What address is this?

More generally: 

https://gswv.apple2.org.za/a2zine/faqs/Csa2KBPADJS.html

[x] Hm, I need to add in handling mapping of the $C800-$CFFF ROM space based on which peripheral card was accessed.

Let's look at the game controller stuff.

| Function | State | Address |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Annunciator 0 | off | $C058 |
| Annunciator 0 | on | $C059 |
| Annunciator 1 | off | $C05A |
| Annunciator 1 | on | $C05B |
| Annunciator 2 | off | $C05C |
| Annunciator 2 | on | $C05D |
| Annunciator 3 | off | $C05E |
| Annunciator 3 | on | $C05F |
| Strobe Output | | $C040 |
| Switch Input | 0 | $C061 |
| Switch Input | 1 | $C062 |
| Switch Input | 2 | $C063 |
| Analog Input | 0 | $C064 |
| Analog Input | 1 | $C065 |
| Analog Input | 2 | $C066 |
| Analog Input | 3 | $C067 |
| Analog Input | Reset | $C070 |


The Analog inputs work like this: hit the reset switch.
Then, read the analog input over and over until the "bit at the appropriate
memory location changes to 0".
About 3millisecond delay. The time it takes to decay is directly proportional
to the resistance across the input.

This is a super-useful looking general purpose - machine identifier, and joystick tester!

Converting a mouse location to a pseudo joystick location shouldn't be too hard. Let's say
we have a sort of "dead" zone in the middle of the virtual display, where the mouse can rest
and the joystick will read 128/128. then it's probably a pretty straight translation to
x/y coordinates of mouse relative to focus window, to a timer.

Well that wasn't bad at all. A weird thing happened playing sabotage, the mouse buttons
stopped firing. Keyboard still worked, and, mouse still steered. So there may be something
weird or it may be a bug in the game crack or something. Choplifter didn't seem to have any
issues. Overall, having the mouse->joystick be linear makes for somewhat slow movement.
Depends on the size of the screen. And I guess you can speed up your mouse movement on the host.

Also, if you zoom off the window and then click, something comes up and covers the screen
and you're way off base. Ah, so what I need is if I click in that window, the mouse locks to that window
and can't leave it.
The mechanics of the analog input simulation work just fine.

OK, the SDL Relative Mouse mode helps. The mouse can't leave. What I did is, when you click
inside the window, it locks mouse to window. Hit F1 to unlock. Shades of deep VMware purple.

in thinking about the shift key mod, it's super easy. However, it needs to tie into the keyboard.
(Just like I did F1 above).
This will be the same with //e, open apple and closed apple which need to map alt to game controller buttons.
But would like it to be a separate module. And there are some other modules that 
tie into the keyboard too where you don't necessarily want the code to handle the *whatever*
in the event loop or keyboard handler. Like, there is keyboard handling for the emulated
machine, and keyboard handling for other stuff.

I think the number of things that will do this is probably relatively small, so create an array
of key values and handler function pointers and just iterate them on a key event.

Todo for this:

[ ] get window dimensions by calling SDL_GetWindowSize
[x] buy a usb joystick and see what is needed for that to work right.


Hm, how hard to go to a fullscreen mode?

## Jan 11, 2025

Push media write protect handling down into the hardware drivers.

have two interfaces for device init.

```
init_mb_DEVICENAME(cpu_state *cpu)
init_slot_DEVICENAME(cpu_state *cpu, int slot)
```

Ultimately a platform definition will include a list of these functions, in order,
to initialize the VM. Pick and choose the ones you want.

ok, did that, then worked on getting this thing to run as a Mac app bundle. That opened a rabbit hole of "where are my resource files? How are resources packaged?"

Learned a lot. A modern Mac app is just a folder with a .app extension. There is some 
metadata, but, this is way better than what they used to call Resource Forks. It's basically just a convention for the Finder. SDL provides some utility functions for finding your Resource folder. This is good for cross-platform. Linux and Windows will then likely work similarly, though Windows you'll register your icon somewhere. Cross that bridge when we get to it.

Also Chat Gippity helped improve structure of the CMakeLists where all the Mac-specific stuff.
Also, changed to require C++17 in order to access std::filesystem and maybe some other stuff.
This will be the start of a bunch of refactoring to make the code more C++17 compliant.
Since I got past my include file location issues of earlier, I can now be consistent and disciplined about using only modern C++ idioms for I/O and other stuff.

So have more thinking to do - for debug output, can write to a file. And create a debug log abstraction. 

[ ] When a VM is off, its window can display the apple logo and the machine name underneath. (e.g. Apple IIe, //c etc.)
[x] edit the icon so it's square, and, has a transparent background where the white is.

Thinking about UI. Two ways to go here.
1. Do a web browser type, discussed above. Gives access to a broad range of UI tools in-browser, except perhaps the one we really need, which is select local file.
1. Switch to SDL3, which has a variety of UI tools and a bunch of other stuff to boot.
1. Stick with SDL2 and use this: https://github.com/btzy/nativefiledialog-extended and other such things.

I suspect switching to SDL3 now is the way to go, before I get too much further invested in SDL2.
and it's got the file dialog stuff, etc.

It looks like the audio stuff may be a bit of a lift - but, it will be cleaner and thread-safe. Important if I'm going
to do multiple VMs at once.

So UI. I have a vision.

Control Window:

The whole Control Window can be shown/hidden with a key shortcut (e.g. F1)

At the top, we have a menu bar with some basic stuff like help, about, quit.

There is a pane you can open to show the current machine's state: picture of the emulated machine (e.g. an Apple IIe pic, IIc pic, IIgs pic, etc.);
effective MHz; etc

Below that, a pane with some controls: reset button, power off, break into debugger; reverse analog input axes; change display mode (color, green screen amber screen);   

An accordion pane with disk drive images, to provide visual feedback on: disk activity; slot and drive; what disk image is mounted; etc.
Click on an eject button to eject a disk from that drive, which will do a clean unmount. Then, click on the disk image to mount a new image.

An accordion pane with info on any other virtual peripherals where it makes sense. map serial / parallel port to real device with an icon of the virtual device (e.g. a super serial card); choose joystick/gamepad device; choose audio device; we could map a serial port to a TCP IP and port (fun); virtual modem (ATDT1.2.3.4); Each device registers its own icon / UI logic.

An optional debugger window. The debugger provides a part GUI / part CLI interface into the system.

An optional printer output window. Of course you can hook up a real printer. I bet a bunch of Apple II software supports HP PCL, and of course later
and GS stuff will support PostScript. The ImageWriter was ubiquitous. Also Epson MX-80.  

Images and iconography are SVG.


SDL3 - ugh! lot of work.
Looks like there is SDL_SetRenderDrawColor which might let us draw with white pixels but translate to a different color. Maybe good for a "green screen" mode or Amber mode.

I ripped the display code out of the emulator and put it in a separate test program. It's working. That is weird. I must have a memory management bug somewhere.

## Jan 12, 2025

OH there was a comment that "the texture is write-only.":
Warning: Please note that SDL_LockTexture() is intended to be write-only; it will not guarantee the previous contents of the texture will be provided. You must fully initialize any area of a texture that you lock before unlocking it, as the pixels might otherwise be uninitialized memory.

That's the issue, and that's what is different between the main thing and the test thing. The test thing is writing the entire texture.
Let me try writing only part of them.

NO that wasn't the issue. Though it could have been.

The issue was very simple: SDL3 defaults to BLEND. Previously we had set hint to overwrite. So, that was that! What a PITA!
Also, it defaults to fuzzy (linear) scaling. This provides a more old-CRT-like effect, which is common on other emulators. But for certain 
applications you might want to use nearest neighbor scaling, which provides exact-sharp pixel scaling. ultimately provide a toggle for this.

OK, I think the last thing I need to do is to get the audio working.

They changed a few things, including how the callback works. Now, the callback is called, and you use a call PUT to put however many bytes
of audio data you want into the stream. This is likely better. What may be even better yet is to include an audio frame processor
into the main event loop. Now I'm curious, I wonder if I can now open a 1-bit channel.. no. But they do offer floating point samples.
Consider that later.

I can shove as much or as little audio data as I want into the stream. It will take care of synchronizing buffers. So I will
do that. We will return data generated in the cpu cycles between this time and last time.

OK! I got the speaker/audio working again this time as a push-based system. Every 17000 'cpu cycles' I generate an audio frame.
However, over time the audio stream is getting delayed more and more. I.e., Out of sync with realtime. 
This means I'm pushing more data than I should, and the player is getting behind playing it.
So I need to compress the output data stream a little if it gets behind.
How do I know if I'm behind? Calculate how many bytes we sent to the player based on cycles, compared to how many we should have sent
based on realtime.

## Jan 13, 2025

I think I'm mostly done with the SDL3 refactor. I am not happy with the audio stuff. I am going to break
it out into a standalone test program to continue to tune it. There is almost certainly a bug somewhere
when handling blips that cross frame boundaries. But I took a long recording of audio and 
will be able to test iterations much faster this way.

In the meantime, clean up the mess in the code and push into the repo.

Watched a video by Chris Torrance on how to do audio.

Post events: cycles AND time. (or, just time).
Then time to samples.

## Jan 14, 2025

First pass at redoing the audio, as a test program, is done. I take the cycle-event recording,
generate audio data, and output to a WAV file. The WAV file reconstruction is based purely on
cycle timing. However, I think I'm underrunning the buffer, so need to fix that.

Then, I need to add the smarts per the Chris Torrance algorithm.

It will be imporant to fix the overall cycle timing. The last iteration, in the audio I was patching
around that. The timing is running a bit fast.

Let's say I have the event loop:

```
while (true) {
a1:
    execute_next();
       fetch opcode & cycle
       fetch operand & cycle (potentially many times)
a2:
    do_some_event_loop_stuff();
a3:
    video_update();
a4:
    every X cycles, generation audio frame.
}
```

When we 'wait', we want to pause for a time based on the last time. I.e., each cycle, 
calculate the next "wakeup" time. Then, any sleep, is "sleep for wakeup_time - current_time".
The wakeup_time is basically a1 + X. Everything else needs to be ignored.
This will take into account all the time spent doing other stuff in rest of the event loop.
And, keep track of whether we fall behind. If we do, we will need to be sure not to trigger
audio and video updates in the same event loop. (That should be easy to fix, do if else if else
instead of if, if.)

One thing that might be required, is to sleep and sync only every X cycles. Instead of trying to
microsleep every cpu cycle, sleeps are likely to be more accurate if we sleep less often for longer.
This also provides more time to do other stuff in the event loop.

Since audio events are recorded based on the cpu cycles, it shouldn't matter if we run 10 instructions
at full speed then sleep some. And it will all be too fast for humans to notice. Hopefully.

The fastest cycle time required to support is the 2.8MHz of the IIgs. Everything else can be
Ludicrous Speed.

At start of program, last_cycle_count = 0, last_cycle_time = GetTicksNS();
We don't know how many cycles will be executed beforehand, because it depends on the opcode
etc.
But, when we're through with an opcode, however many minimum number of cycles, we keep track of that
with cpu->cycles - last_cycle_count. 

Unless there is a slip event - the next target time should be calculated based on the **original start time**.

next_cycle_time = start_cycle_time + (ns_per_cycle * cycles_elapsed)
WaitNS(next_cycle_time - GetTicksNS())

Let's just do a test program for cycle timing.

Simple loop, I can do busy waits pretty well. I run 30 iterations, and I wake up right on time.
A single printf in the loop causes the timing to be off by a total of 130,000 to 260,000 ns over the 
loop.

## Jan 16, 2025

### Threads vs short bursts of free-run CPU

### Free-run bursts

I think we definitely need to be smarter about how we handle cycle timing.
One issue I was thinking about, is that the time it takes to execute a video frame update
is not 0. It's also not constant. In a real system, it's going on in the background, constantly.
Not just each 1/60th second. I think it makes sense to do this as a separate thread. Same with the audio.
The other general event processing, maybe. Some of that is probably pretty fast.
Certainly, anything that might print to the console is going to be slow as we've seen. 250-500 microseconds.
I've demonstrated that, absent doing things that take a huge amount of time, we can key pretty accurately
on cycle times with the nanosecond precision of SDL_GetTicksNS().

One approach is to separate cpu from other stuff in separate threads. Another, is to bunch up CPU
processing into bursts. I.e. not try to delay and sync every cycle, but instead run a bunch of cycles,
then execute 'stuff', then do a cycle sync.

My concern with this is over things like, say, reading the keyboard. So let's say we read the keyboard in
a tight loop like apples do. The average user might type a key every 1-2 seconds. An Apple II would
wait for keyboard like 500,000 loop iterations during that time. maybe it's going to do other things too. I guess if the
resolution of these is still much higher than human reaction time, it won't be noticeable. But, I still am
unsure about it. I guess the only way is to try it.

Video frames are 60 times per second. Audio maybe 30-60.

So a loop would be:

```
free-run CPU for 17,008 cpu cycles. (60fps @ 1.0205mhz)
video update.
audio update.
whatever else update.
wait/sleep for end of 17,000 cpu cycle.
```

17K cycles is 16,667 microseconds.
or, 16,667,000 nanoseconds. That seems like a fair bit of time to get things done.

We could do this at 100fps or 120fps. (Still only update the video 60fps). That's 8M nanoseconds.
What if we "free run" one instruction, then do other stuff. 1 instruction is anywhere from 2 to 6/7
cycles. That's 2000 to 7000 nanoseconds. A few thousand instructions.

This shouldn't be that hard to implement.

```
last_cycle_count; last_cycle_time;

execute_next();
do_some_other_stuff();
busy wait until (current_time > last_cycle_time + (this_cycle_count - last_cycle_count) * ns_per_cycle)

loop
```

This loop can operate with however many "execute_next" in a row we want. i.e. can have an inner loop
that does X instructions. This will always sync up afterward.

Today we have huge numbers of clock slips because we can't get much of anything done in the one microsecond
we have after the last cycle of an instruction.

Let's try this first.

Weird audio artifacts. Not worried about that right now. Doing a loop every instruction, we are getting a few
thousand slips per minute.

Let's do an inner loop of 10 instructions.

Ha! Now I'm getting almost exactly 300 slips per 5 seconds. That's 60 slips per second, i.e., video/audio frames.

ok, how about 100 instructions. (100-500 microseconds).. 11 to 12 slips per second.
free-run 17000 cycles:
   5119863 delta 75640749 cycles clock-mode: 2 CPS: 1.023973 MHz [ slips: 4, busy: 0, sleep: 0]

virtually no slips. Two weird artifacts: clicks when clicking in and out of the window.
and, on boot, the display didn't properly clear after showing all 0's.

Also note that the frequency check is now reading 1.023973. 

Remember I think clicks are due to underruns. The current speaker code is only ever emitting +1 or -1, but 
I bet the audio system fills in with 0s when it's behind.

Choplifter works well. Taxman did too. I did in fact see some screen flicker with this approach. If we implement
the IIe VBL register, and set it appropriately (hmm, it should basically always be off), then newer stuff
will work well. Notably I didn't get clicks on this run. It probably happens when it starts with timing
slightly wonky. 

ha! Forgot. I'm running the absolutely wrong audio code.

On a clock speed change, we need to bail out of the CPU thread early, to give our algorithm a chance
to resync to the new clock speed.

Overall so far this is working well. Just the video bug on startup.

### Threads

A second option is to do multiple threads. This will add pretty significant complexity, requiring mutex around
shared data structures. Let's examine.

SDL video updates can only occur from the main thread. That's pretty definitive. If video has to be on main
thread, then the CPU is going to have to be an alternate thread.

SDL has some support for inter-thread communication. SDL_RunOnMainThread() requests a callback be run on the main thread. There is also the ability to define custom messages for the event queue, and pass messages between threads this way.

So let's look at the data structures we have, and consider them in a multithreaded context.

Video memory. Video ram is written to by CPU. Then read by video code. As long as the location of the video
RAM doesn't change, then this is one-way data flow and should be thread safe. The CPU thread writing new values
into video memory won't hurt or break the video update process. it could cause flicker. But that's like the
real computer.

Paravirtual disk driver. right now, the cpu is sort of 'halted' and disk I/O performed reading or writing into
CPU RAM, then cpu resumed. This will not likely happen in space between cycles. So CPU would halt, disk I/O
performed in a separate thread, then CPU resume. We also don't want this I/O to tie up the video or audio
output.

For GS, there will be a keyboard buffer. There are several bits of hardware like that. That's all going to be
write at one point and read from another point. Synchronization here not strictly required.

The audio event buffer is like that, too. If over overrun (overfill the buffer) then events just have to get dropped.
But, we should be able to manage this w/o mutexes.

In fact, any mutex here could re-cause the problem we're trying to avoid. So these must be done anywhere
except in the CPU thread.

If we go this second route, then we get our support for multiple VMs much more easily.

Support vertical blanking sync emulation would be a lot easier as a separate thread. And the
IIgs "3200 colors" mode, which is vertical blanking sync on steroids, would also not likely work
without a multi-threaded approach.

Certain devices will have a "cpu context" and an "event loop context". E.g., video is split.
The CPU thread will decode a video address to set the line dirty flag. But it won't do the 
video update itself. Code that runs from memory_write etc also needs to be sure to be short.

## Revisiting the speaker code.

ok now that we have the clocking synced pretty well at 1.0205MHz (1.020571 to be precise),
let's revisit speaker code.

yes, I improved cycle timing in audio3, and the buzzing has gone away while it's running, and it's staying
very well synced.

The trick will be how to make that work at 2.8MHz and in Ludicrous Speed.

## Jan 17, 2025

audio4 (current iteration of the audio test) isn't bad. the timing is good. The algorithm needs to be improved
per Torrance. So. Let's do that, then, change the buffer algorithm to:

1. Call audio_generate_frame() roughly every 17ms. (As best as we can).
1. calculate number of samples to generate based on time elspsed since last call into audio_generate_frame(). Because it's critical that we generate enough samples to keep the buffer from underrunning.
1. map a cpu cycle range to the samples range. This will be based on the effective cycles per second: time_delta / cycles_delta.
1. Iterate the samples.

The naive approach is:
1. Loop number of samples:
    1. count cycles one by one, checking the queue for events.
        1.   If there's an event, switch the sign of contribution.
        1.   add +1 (or -1) for each cycle (i.e. iterate for cycles_per_sample).
    1. emit sample, repeat

Downside of this approach is that we have a loop iteration for every cycle.
It feels like it would be better to iterate only the samples and do some 
math to figure out how many cycles to skip. Let's get this working first,
then see if we can improve it.

When the emulator starts up, and this is a big difference from the audio4 test program,
we immediately encounter clock slips:

```

 ```

 The first time through the loop is fine, but then there is a huge delay to get
 back around. 
 There is an initial huge jump. The video is being called. I bet there is a bunch of
 setup required in event_poll(), the video display, etc the first we call them.
 So, call them once before the CPU loop starts.

I've been jiggering around with the audio code. There are lots of assumptions here.
One was, the stream doesn't start automatically, but I think that might have been wrong. The SDL 
docs are inconsistent on this point.

The first time to audio_generate_frame, we do nothing.
The second time through, we're generating only 69 samples because the time delta
is only 1.5 microseconds. so that's why we underrun. Why is this..

the issue is that something near startup is sucking up a lot of time in the first
couple loops. Instrument to see what this is. There is a big jump in cycle time delta.

OK after a herculean (well perhaps I exaggerate) effort, I've got the audio working, at 1MHz
at least. At ludicrous speed, several things aren't working right.

At higher speeds, quickly gets out of sync. Cross that bridge later. The 1-bit speaker
is sort of ludicrous at 250MHz anyway ha ha. (It's playing back events at 1MHz speed no matter what, 
but at faster speeds it's loading up the buffer way faster). When speed shifting, flush the audio
buffer. (for a IIgs running Apple II stuff in emulation mode, slow down to 1MHz when PB=0 or PB=1).

Video - there is no restriction on the video update rate.

If we are in ludicrous speed, limit video updates to 60fps. ok, done. I did for events, etc. So we're back to 

```
1280493489 delta 4415324039 cycles clock-mode: 0 CPS: 256.098694 MHz [ slips: 0, busy: 0, sleep: 0]
```

256MHz apple II. I mean, come on man.

ok what's next?

I'm going to implement green and amber text and lores modes, and implement a color mode switch.

But then I need to do a code cleanup and move globals and statics in a few places into structs attached
to the cpu_state.

For that (which I should implement for this color mode thing as the first implementation of it), I need
a generalized data storage thing. If this was JavaScript I would just pile things into an associative array,
or properties.

But this is C++, and we need to allocate memory. What if I do an enum of 'names' ('properties'), and then
the cpu_state has an array of void pointers. Each module that needs this type of storage gets a name assigned.
When it needs its state, it typecasts the pointer to its correct type. Then the cpu_state doesn't care
what the structs look like. If a module needs multiple chunks it can define its static struct to have them.

## Jan 19, 2025

OK that's done for the display code. Wasn't too bad. I even made it a class instead of a struct to use
a constructor init. Will be pushing the codebase more into this direction.

For color-mode switch, I need to figure out how to display lo-res on a greenscreen. And, I need color
hi-res.

To do hi-res properly I need to double the number of horizontal pixels to simulate the phase shifting.
I think I probably also want to implement a border around the simulated NTSC screen. (GS will eventually require
this because you can set the border color).

these are pretty good discussions of hi-res:
https://forums.atariage.com/topic/241626-double-hi-res-graphics/page/4/
https://nicole.express/2024/phasing-in-and-out-of-existence.html

Hm found a bug. There is a bizarro artifact. If there is text update on lines y=22 or =23, it gets
blasted into the borders both bottom and right.

I don't think I'm doing anything wrong. If I don't specify the dstrect or srcrect, it defaults to scaling the texture to the window size. If I
specify dstrect, or, dstrect and srcrect, I get the artifacts in the odd places.

Yep. If I select the opengl renderer, it works fine. Using the default renderer (specifying with 'null' in CreateRenderer) 
I get the artifacts. WEIRD. And annoying.

So now I'll have to read up on these. And I guess send in a bug report to SDL.

ok Color Hi-res.

Understanding the Apple II has the best discussion of this. That guy was a genius.

Let's see if I can boil the rules down.
1. Two adjacent one bits are white. I.e., even if we set a pixel as a color due to preceding 0 bit, a second 1 bit in a row will turn the previous dot and the current dot white.
1. If even dot is turned on, they are violet.
1. Odd dots are green.

If the high bit of a hi-res byte is set, then the signal is delayed by 1/2 a dot, and the colors
violet and green become blue and orange.

Delayed and undelayed signals interfere with each other. So if we go from a 0 to 1 or 1 to 0, there will be special
stuff happening at the edges of that intersection.

"There are 560 dot positions in a row. Color depends on position. There are 140 violet,
140 green, 140 blue, and 140 orange positions."

"Any time you plot a green dot in the same 7-dot pattern as an orange dot, that orange dot
turns to green because D7 had to be reset in that memory location to plot the green dot.

Two adjacent color dots of the same color appear solid because of analog switch time and blurring. This is simulated
on Apple2TS by drawing 3 purple dots in a row in a case like this.

Pages 8-21 to 8-23:
The first 14M period of a delayed pattern (bit 7 = 1) is controlled by the last dot of the previous pattern.
Switching from 1 to 0 (delayed to undelayed) "will cut off the tail of the current pattern, cuts the last
dot in half".
cutting off or extending the dot has the effect of slightly changing the dot pattern and noticaebly,
changing the coloring of the border dots.
LORES colors 7 and 2 can be produced at even/odd memory addressing order.
Colors D and 8 can be produced at odd/even borders.
Colors B and E can be produced at odd/even or even/odd borders.
Lores 7 can also be produced at the far left of the screen, and color E can produced
at the far right.
color 1 can be produced only at the far left the hires screen. orange hires dots at the right side of the screen
are dark brown.

So Apple IIts has handled some of this (the stuff in-line) , but not all of it (the stuff that crosses scanlines). This all sounds complex but it's a fairly simple set of rules, I think.

In any event my idea of using the 560 dot positions seems correct.
```
                     0.1.2.3.4.5.6.
2000: 01             *_______
2400: 81             _*______
2800: 02             __*_____
2c00: 82             ___*____
```
creates a purple dot, then blue, then green, then orange, in very tight pixel positions.
Numbers on the top are a whole dot position. The periods are a half dot position. My IIe monitor
is super-fringy, you can clearly see a half dot, a full dot, and a half dot of each single color.

If hi bit of a byte is set, we will plot into odd pixel positions. And pick color based on 
bits being last=0, current =1; last=1, current=0; last=0, current=0; last=1, current=1. Keep a
sliding window of 2 bits.

So, a design choice. Do we make the entire Texture 560 pixels and change the scaling factor.
Or, only change for hires? I think it would be simpler to do all of them. The text and lores
code will need to change to plot twice as many horizontal pixels.

Thinking about this - color fringe effect on split screen text and lores/hires, the text pixels will be
colored exactly as if they were hires pixels with hi bit always cleared.
So architecturally, perhaps we paint everything into 560, and have a post-processing step that does
the coloration, which would be the same for all modes. Have to ponder how lores fits into this scheme
too, i.e., how are the pixels shifted there.. don't have to post-process. just draw using the hi-res algo,
but draw the data from the text matrix.

There will be an "RGB Monitor" mode that will have no doubling of color hires pixels and no text fringe; and 
composite mode that will fringe text and blue the color hires.


## Jan 20, 2025

It's the third Monday in January! You know what that means! It's National GSSquared Got Color Hi-Res Day!

So the above wasn't too bad at all. 

Like I did with the hgr function, move the x = 0 to 40 loops for text and lores into those routines.

All dislay rendering is now done with scanlines, i.e., an entire row of pixels horizontally.
This moves loop inside the render function, saving a bunch of function calls. Also makes
the API for a display handler consistent across all display types.

of course, it wasn't a bug - I had a brief exchange with the SDL lead dev and he pointed out
I needed to do SDL_RenderClear() every single frame. This is part of the GPU voodoo I don't have
experience with. But now I do! A little anyway.

## Jan 22, 2025


There are SDL variables that can make the drawing even blurrier. Experiment with them.

For the color-stretch mode, I'd say, if I draw a color dot and two dots to the left is the same color,
fill in the middle dot with same color.
I am also not sure about the drawing the white dot algorithm as it is. Review it and compare to other examples.

Hi-res tweaks. "Composite" mode is drawing too many pixels I think. Instead of 2 pixels (4 dots) maybe do 1.5 pixels (3 dots)?
letters like lowercase 'm' are completely filled in, and that's not quite right..

So I'm trying the Introducing the Apple II disk. It said it was iie only. it's running on my II+-ish.
it understands lowercase, but, they are reversed. shift-letter gives me lowercase. letter gives me uppercase.
I bet that's because my keyboard routines are not converting to uppercase when I am holding shift. That's funny.
up and down arrow don't work because I never mapped them. Can't play the rabbit game then!

To get sound working on the Linux build:
install libasound2-dev libpulse-dev
and doing a cmake reconfigure. Works great with the $15 USB speaker I bought. That's just crazy, and fun. I remember how expensive sound cards used to be. And that didn't even include the speakers.

Experimenting with window resizing. I have it constraining size to the correct aspect ratio, and, 
modifying the scale factor in the renderer to match. Now test full screen mode. We'll toggle that
based on the F3 key since I already have F11 used for something else.

I think there is a bug in the lo-res code now where on switching to lo-res mode it's not dirtying the lines
to force a redraw. At least, my lo-res apple is not being drawn on boot of some of these disks. Ah, it was
a change in the code that reacts to writes to text memory. I "optimized" it to only do text updates
in lower portion when in graphics mode. But needed to also check to hi-res mode.

Full screen mode works but it allows use of the wrong aspect ratio. I think in fullscreen mode we need to 
force the scale to match aspect ratio, then center content inside the fullscreen window.

[ ] in game code, window_width and height need to read the actual window size, or, use some other method
to constrain the mouse movement.

The new gamepad arrived. This one is bluetooth and wired (supposedly). Compatible with everything supposedly. Works
on the Mac. I have it coded in to GS2 and it's working well. One notable thing, is if you go straight horizontal or vertical, it will scale to +/- 32767. IF you go diagonal, it will scale to +/- 24000 or so. The range of motion on the joystick is actually circular, whereas on the original apple II joystick it was square. I get the rationale here, my recollection is that the Apple II stick would sometimes get bound up in the corners.

This thing has a crazy number of controls. There are like throttle buttons on each side, that are pressure-sensitive (i.e.
scale depending on how far you depress them). Four X / Y / A / B buttons. And of course the four-way nintendo style + control. I am unclear on how button mappings work, and it is possible I will have to switch to the "gamepad" API which supposedly handles all the axis and button mapping stuff for you. Look into that more.

But I have successfully played the ole Choplifter with it. It's a lot easier with a proper joystick, even if it is
tiny compared to my original II stick, which I really miss. (Those things were great).

This had some sample code that helped me get started.

## Jan 25, 2025

This doc has a pretty useful description of the hi-res circuitry.

"Apple II Circuit Description"
https://ia902301.us.archive.org/31/items/apple-ii-circuit-description/Image081317140426.merged.pdf

also the game controller stuff. That is extremely simple. I am pondering building paddles.

Need to re-do the gamecontroller logic to use the GameController API instead. This will help ensure compatibility with many different gamepad controller devices.

Interesting thought: map the nintendo style + control to A Z ARROWS or IJKL as an option. If we put a single game onto a floppy, that disk image could have
metadata to indicate what the controller - keyboard mapping should be. That is actually some hot stuff right there. Define some sort of metadata format.
Probably JSON, easy to store and generate and work with.

Other metadata: minimum system requirements. 

## Jan 27, 2025

had an idea. Do a "screen shot" key, that will dump $2000 to $3FFF to a file. Then we can write a hi-res tester that will much more easily
allow us to test hi-res rendering. Like what I did with the audio recording and test stuff. Yah baby.

## Jan 30, 2025

looking at the disk II code. The program Applesauce actually visualizes a disk image showing the sectors, data, etc.
There are some interesting differences in how mine looks versus their nibblization. First off, they show stuff on the quarter tracks.
Like, why. Overall, my image is darker. Probably because of the quarter track thing. Anyway.
Their nibblization has the following differences to mine:
They have more Sync A bytes than I do. 120 vs 80.
They have FEWER Sync B bytes. 6 vs 10.
Fewer Sync C than me. 17 vs 20.
Of course, in their thing, they display the sync bytes as 10 bit. Is that relevant to anything?
That said, their gap duration is a bit LONGER than mine - 657 microseconds vs 626. This is because of the 10-bit thing.
Perhaps I should *extend* my gaps a bit to make them the same number of microseconds. It's possible code isn't getting back
to this part of the read loop fast enough, and skipping. Though that would feel like 'stop working' entirely since it would
be exactly the same each time. Something to consider.

I found a "blank.nib" file. That image does not look like clean conical slices. Every track is skewed relative to the last one.
Inside a single track I'm fine. When we skip to the next track, we might have to wait a whole revolution. Whereas a regular inited
disk is probably more like the skewed version (blank.nib) because there is no sector alignment on the Apple II. And that
might affect performance. This would be implemented by starting the next track at the current location, and wrapping
the write position around based on wherever the virtual head is. NOT resetting to 0. This would really depend on the specific
init process used on a disk.

Looking at "DOS 3.3 System Master.woz" which is another nibblied format - that DOES track the 10-bit vs 8-bit thing.
These sectors are lined up in clean cones. And it has the quarter tracks too. Of course, .woz does not imply nibblized.
It can contain other formats too.

I think another difference between mine and the others, is that the blank space at the end of a track is all 0's in my image.
And the gap is large - it amounts to almost an entire sector width.

In blank.nib, the tracks are exactly 0x1A00 long as in mine. But, their tracks definitely do not always start with a sync gap.
```
0019F0: FF FF FF FF  FF FF FF FF  FF FF FF FF  FF FF FF FF  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
001A00: B2 B7 CE B2  B7 CE A6 E7  D9 AF 9B A6  E6 DA AE 9A  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
001A10: DC D9 9B 9A  CB CE B2 B7  CE FE F9 9B  AC DA DE AA  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
001A20: EB FF EB FF  FE FF FF FF  FF FF FF FF  FF FF FF FF  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
```

We go from sync bytes directly into some data. Then sync pattern later. This is what generates the skewed pattern we see.

This is being triggered by how much faster an image seems to boot up in apple2ts. I should time the same image in both
a2ts and gs2. Do that tomorrow when I'm not yawning.

Walking through the tracks in blank.nib one by one, each track starts with a different sector. F, then E, then D, etc.

[ ] So, those two things to try: (1) pad out the sector gaps to make their uS duration similar to these other nibs; and do the skew
thing. And if there are any bytes left, we should pad out with FF instead of with 00. (2) try just jumping to next track at
same byte index, instead of resetting to 0.

I did a fair bit of work today, on arqyv. Got the vm setup, got asimov mirrored. There are other sites to mirror. I'm going to
need a lot more storage for those, likely (I'd prefer to just host here but Xfinity upload is too slow). If I ever get fiber again
I can self-host it.

So I can test this by d/l some nib format disks that are done this way and see how fast they are.

## Jan 31, 2025

So, add .nib support to the diskii routines.

Kaves of Karkhan seems to boot and play. It's a copy-protected disk that uses AB as the sync byte instead of FF.
There may be other differences too. But, the emulation works well enough to do this!

## Feb 1, 2025

The .Woz format document has some very interesting and useful info about copy protection schemes. And about the hardware.
Take-aways:

https://applesaucefdc.com/woz/reference1/

"Every soft switch on an even address should actually return the value of the data latch."

Also, "1 second delay after accessing the drive motor off" at $C088,X needs to be implemented.

We might need a concept that the virtual disk is spinning underneath the head. E.g., each time we're read, check the CPU
cycle count and move the virtual head position accordingly. 4uS per bit.

Also, "When you do change tracks, you need to start the new bitstream at the same relative bitstream position – you cannot simply start the pointer at the beginning of the stream. You need to maintain the illusion of the head being over the same area of the disk, just shifted to a new track."

This is for copy protection purposes. Finally,

"Now that we are back to having long runs of 0s in the bitstream, we now need to emulate the MC3470 freaking out about them. The recommended method is that once we have passed three 0 bits in a row from the WOZ bitstream to the emulated disk controller card, we need to start passing in random bits until the WOZ bitstream contains a 1 bit. We then send the 1 and continue on with the real data."

That is pretty wild. 

This document is implying that it stores the extra 0 bits in a track stream in the sync nibbles. Will need to find a .woz 
image of some crazy copy protected disk to test this. (And review with Applesauce).

## Feb 2, 2025

So I have some various stuff working to support the Apple II Memory Expansion Card.
The C8xx mapping, for one, and CFFF de-mapping.
Booting ProDOS, is causing a hang. I must have done something wrong. I will manually exercise
the 'hardware' to test.

## Feb 4, 2025

So, when there are things that are about to happen that we know will suck up a bunch of time (for example, opening a file dialog), we can Pause the audio stream until that call has completed. Other things in this realm would be, loading a floppy disk image.

After opening a file dialog, our window is no longer in focus. I have to click to bring it into focus, then click again to open the dialog again.

The dialog thing is only callable from the main thread. So we're back to considering, is this fine, or, do we need to put the CPU and audio into their own threads, to prevent stuff like this from interfering with the (one, really) realtime aspect to the software?

## Feb 9, 2025

When the OSD is open, keyboard and mouse events should go to it. So, perhaps the event routine should do this: return true if the event was handled, false if not. 

The joystick is now reading upside down in Choplifter. Is there a flag for controlling how the axes are read?

## Feb 11, 2025

Looking at Disk II code. When we switch tracks, we DO have the head in the same relative index into the track data. What we are not simulating, is the disk continuing to spin under the head when the CPU is off doing other stuff. 

The math here should be:

3.910us per bit. 

| Gap | Our bits | Applesauce bits | Action | 
|-----|----------|-----------------|------|
| Gap A | 640 | 1198 | add 1198 - 640 / 8 = 69 bytes more FF |
| Gap B | 80 | 60 | remove 1 byte FF |
| Gap C | 160 | 168 | add 1 byte FF |

Gap A is track start.

Now, at end, we also need to write 0xFF to the end of the track buffer. So from whatever the index is, through 0x19FF. That I did. Didn't make a difference.

I don't measure much difference at this point between the A2 emulator I downloaded and GS2.

## Feb 12, 2025

Bring checking of application-specific hot keys back into main event handler area, and out of 'keyboard'. We will have multiple keyboard handlers at some point.

Make speed control buttons.

## Feb 13, 2025

thinking about halt. Two things shouldn't crash the emulator:
* Halt (STP instruction)
* jump to self (infinite loop).

Now, we can treat the second as a case of the first. So what we want to do on a HLT, is, continue the event loop but stop executing instructions on the CPU. OK, this has been taken care of. On reset, halt is cleared. We only exit the event loop if halt is set to HLT_USER. (i.e., F12 or window close).

I disabled the jump to self test. We may want to enable it under special circumstances (i.e., running the test suite).

### Reset button

that was pretty quick.

### Power On / Power Off Button

Isolate the stuff that allocates memory, etc, and starts up the CPU. This is as distinguished from setting up the display window, and other host-level stuff.

Like, I should do something! The big daddy is to mount new disk images from the OSD. So let's work on that.

### Need to draw a black background with 100% opacity before we draw anything else in the OSD. Or, just fill the rest of the OSD. I may not be filling the entire thing.

### Hook up mount disk image code

let's do the naive approach first - change out the disk image from inside the callback handler. Apparently these are called from the event loop. We may assume it will take some significant amount of time to process the mount. That means we will likely need to fire off a thread to do it. But, start first and then measure.

Create a util/mount_unmount.cpp file to handle these.

## Feb 14, 2025

We need some kind of hook between the OSD display stuff, and something we can query to get and manipulate the status of disk drives, from a higher level than the diskii module for instance. From the GUI, we need to:

mount media
unmount media
write protect media (eventually)
query status (running, mounted, write protected, etc.)

The status will tell us how to display the particular widget in the OSD.

## Feb 15, 2025

Fixed a bug in the system - only 48K RAM was being allocated but of course the language card was using memory locations above that. Somehow that was working on the Mac, mostly, but blew chunks quickly on Linux. Enabled bounds checking in CMake Debug and rapidly diagnosed the problem, as well as a few other bounds problems.

The checks also identify memory leaks. There is a small amount of that going on right now. Of course we largely don't deallocate any memory on shutdown. Investigate later.

## Feb 16, 2025

We are now successfully mounting disk images at runtime. Was able to play Oregon Trail which requires flipping back and forth between two disks. And, can pretty reliably switch disks in DOS / ProDOS and CAT/CATALOG etc.

The OSD display of the drives does not track the actual drive status though. Have to somehow tie that in.

Getting close. However, the diskii drive motor never turns off. Here's what is happening:
* drive is running
* sector read
* drive off sent
* timer is set
* but the disk code never hits any diskii softswitches again, so I never get a chance to see the timer expired and to turn the motor off.

So, the diskII module needs to be called periodically to check on timers and update state.

I need a way for a slot to register a callback, called whenever a timer expires. SDL has SDL_AddTimer(), however, I am thinking of a more general purpose mechanism. Some devices will ultimately need to generate interrupts on the basis of timers.

Also, diskII needs a reset handler. From UTA2: "Pressing RESET causes the delay timer to clear and turns off the drive almost immediately."

ok, some progress. Drive status working. Need to be able to unmount, not just mount new media.

I sort of have mounting image on Drive 2 working. However, I get an I/O error or infinite spin the first time I catalog,d2. SEems like I'm overlooking a state change to drive 2 somewhere. If I then RESET, and try again, it works. OK. When I've booted, and then I do a catalog,s6,d2, it turns on the motor on drive 1, not drive 2! I reset, then do it again, then it turns on the motor on drive 2!

It's not seeing my motor on after doing drive_select 1 the first time:
I have a drive 0 motor 0 for some reason..

```
slot 6, drive 0, motor 0
slot 6, drive 0, drive_select 1
```

second time it does it:
```
slot 6, drive 1, motor 0
slot 6, drive 1, drive_select 1
slot 6, drive 1, motor 1
```

doing catalogs, the wrong motor drive light is coming on sometimes.

I guess I will need to read the UTA2 again. 

Whatever drive was last selected, if I try to catalog the other one, it barfs with I/O error. Then doing it again, works. It's probably not reading anything, it does a lot of CHUGGAS to try to reset the head, and then still fails, so gets I/O error.

## Feb 18, 2025

Thunderclock Plus firmware is now loaded, and confirmed working with ProDOS 1.1.1 disk. TCP DOS utils disk also worked.

It is however acting le funky using the TCP ProDOS utils disk. Dos 3.3 one booted and worked.. like it is reading register C090 => 00 in an infinite loop, never returning.
That's not cool, bro.

something caused cpu->cycle count to reset to 0; is it my reset routine or something? That's not right. cycle count should be set to 0 only on power up.

Apparently the CFFF to disable slot card map into C800, works on read or write. So tweaked that.

Trying to troubleshoot why the TCP c800 firmware isn't coming in and out properly. Here's the deal:

* whenever CnXX is read or written to, C8xx is enabled for that slot. IF it's not already enabled?
* read or write to CFFF turns that rom off.
* in memory_read, if the page type is RAM or ROM, we're fine. I just changed it so that if the page type is IO, we call the memory_bus_read handler.
* However, this means once a page is set to I/O, we are not reading memory values from the ROM.

In memory_bus_read after checking all the various I/O addresses, I return by reading the memory mapped value, instead of returning 0xEE. So far that seems to be working okay.

Now, still have the issue where we get infinite C090 reads. ok, the demo program 'clock' is doing "-TUT" which is loading the sys program TUT. That is what is infinite looping. I think that loads a new ProDOS command called TIME. TIME %, TIME #, etc then generate some output the basic program reads in.

Clock is a cute program that displays a seconds-ticking clock with moving hour, minute, and second hand. The DOS33 version works.
I must be missing a hardware command somehow. There is a program TEST on the DOS33 disk. It says my thunderclock is not operating properly.

```
Thunderclock Plus write register C090 value 40
Thunderclock Plus write register C090 value 0
```

in VirtualII, if I do this:
```
C0f0:40
c0f0:00
c0f0
c0f0-60
c0f8 (clear interrupt)
c0f0-40
```

So on a pure read, 0x20 is the interrupt set bit.

So it's turning on interrupts. And I'm not generating one, so it is probably then turning interrupts off and saying you failed, I didn't get an interrupt.


This is what I get when I tell it to set the interrupt rate to 1/64 sec.
```
Thunderclock Plus write register C090 value 0
Thunderclock Plus write register C090 value 20
Thunderclock Plus write register C090 value 24
Thunderclock Plus write register C090 value 20
Thunderclock Plus write register C090 value 40
Thunderclock Plus write register C090 value 40
Thunderclock Plus write register C090 value 40
```

The behavior of Cn00, C800, CFFF seems that once a particular slot is latched in, you HAVE to CFFF to disconnect it, and only then can you enable a different slot. This behavior is unclear.

This is correct. The first card hit will "hold on" until CFFF is accessed. 

## Feb 19, 2025

I have the data sheet for the UPD1990AC which is the clock chip used in the Thunderclock Plus. It is not very clear, it's in Japanglish. 

I did a detour and implemented a "generic prodos clock" device. This supports only month date day of week hour minute. But it's something.

The main bit of the TCP that will be complex, is supporting its timer interrupts. There is also a "test mode" which says it increments every counter in parallel 1024 hz. like, why, what does this do. I see that other emulators also moved to support No Slot Clock, and, generic prodos clock, instead of the TCP. Though one does attempt to emulate the TCP interrupt timers.

Consider this. We run chunks of 6502 code in bursts of 17,000 cycles, 60 times per second. In order to support a timer interrupt of 1/64, 1/256, and 1/2048 second intervals, we would need to create an event queue and have the CPU loop pick those events up each iteration. Because we don't execute the code evenly (i.e., it's fullspeed during each burst) then we can't use real system timers. And that's probably okay.

So, the timer routine would "post" an event to occur based on a calculated number of cycles.

```
cpu->cycles + (cycles_per_second / 64)
cpu->cycles + (cycles_per_second / 256)
cpu->cycles + (cycles_per_second / 2048)
```

if at the top of the cpu instruction handler we have hit this timer, we call the device interrupt handler.

Let's think about this a bit too from the perspective of something like a serial card, where we may want to generate an IRQ on an incoming character. Characters do come in quite a lot faster than 1/60th second. They'll get buffered of course, but, if we have it in interrupt mode, in a separate thread, and it comes in while executing code, we want to trigger the interrupt. Even if not an interrupt, we want to set the "data ready" flag. nah, character ready check would just check a buffer. That's no biggy. It's more specifically interrupt stuff where we want to use this queue.

We will need this same stuff when we get to the IIgs emulation, since it has a variety of built-in IRQ generating devices.

So, this is a proposal for an Interrupt event queue. And it will be a lot like the audio event queue. Do we actually need a queue? What if we just emulate IRQ systems. I.e., each device or slot triggers IRQ. All the IRQs are ORd together. Interrupt handler has to search for the device that triggered it. 

We'll have some callbacks that can be registered for timers / etc. Each iteration through the CPU loop, we call the routine. The routine will set a flag if the timer IRQ should fire.

IRQ status for the devices stored in a 64 bit bitfield. We can check for -any- IRQ by checking if that value is non-zero. The position of each one bit indicates which devices' callback to call. They can be registered in an array of callback handlers (up to 64 of them).

Instead of an ordered set or something, just do this sort of optimized thing:

* bit field - each bit is assigned to a particular device.
* array of handlers, array element corresponding to the bit position.
* array of "next cycle triggers", also corresponding to the bit position.
* once a trigger is called, the bit is cleared.
* if the device wants, it sets the bit again.
* Each time a next cycle trigger is reached, the next cycle is determined and stored. As an optimization so we don't scan the list every time, we scan it only when it needs to be updated.
* Whenever a event is registered, if the cycle desired is less than current next cycle trigger, we update the trigger to that.

## Feb 22, 2025

Taking a look at OpenEmulator, another Mac A2 emu. It is Mac specific, they claim other platforms coming but never got done.

Uses 3D effects to simulate CRT monitor "barrel distortion" and such. I think it's overkill. It's fairly accurate I think. It's flash mode is quite a bit faster than mine. I may have that wrong. I can check on the IIe. I do!

Clock speed: only 1MHz and Free Run are working correctly. 2.8 and 4MHz are not working right. They are both reading at like 1.2-1.4mhz effective rate.

I had an idea about the audio/speaker handler. Whenever C030 is tweaked, have it write directly into the audio buffer. However, the problem there is that could take up a lot of real cpu time.

another idea: whenever we change clock speed, flush current audio buffer and reset parameters so the new buffer is calculated only at new clock speed.

Maybe I need to tweak the number of clock cycles we run each burst. In fact that might be the issue with 2.8MHz and 4MHz. We need to run more emulated cycles at higher clock speeds. Let's see..

In free run mode, we run 17000 cycles per burst. Then we check to execute audio, video, and events only once every 1/60th second realtime.

In 1MHz mode, we run 17000 cycles per burst. Then check. Then sleep until next burst. So yeah, we definitely need to run more cycles at higher clock speeds. OK, easily done.. That's not quite right. When I do a simple lookup table, the flash gets faster. What? Ah my lookup table is in the wrong order. still not right. Duh have to use the lookup table, not just define it. THERE WE GO.

(I consolidated all the clock mode variables into a single place).

Uh, all the sudden audio is working correctly at higher speeds. It seems the audio code was written correctly, but, I was calling it in the wrong context.

WHEE!!!!

Reading some of the OpenEmulator code. It draws pixels out purely as a bitstream, then, it uses OpenGL shaders to render the pixels in different modes (RGB, Composite). The shader is readable-ish. It uses vector processing in the GPU, I see reference to PI in there. So it's definitely implementing something like the approach I've been testing on in hgr5 - simulating a color wheel.

hgr5 and hgr6 differ in how they handle starting the scan line. On the first couple pixels, we do not have enough prior pixel data to do a proper average from. So what should we start it with?  hgr5 averages only the samples we have. hgr6 averages the samples we have with zeroes.

Once you're 3-4 pixels into the scanline, it actually seems to be working really well.

If we adopt this technique, then we could use it for every mode. And I have been digging into this because handling DHR the way I've been doing HR is going to be problematic - it will just be too complex. But DHR with this color wheel thing will be pretty straightforward. Also, text with fringing in mixed mode will work this way too. Just emit the same bit stream. And lo-res would work this way too.

## Feb 23, 2025

I just had an incident where there was a blip, and then the audio got delayed by a good 30-45 seconds or so. So there may be some edge case bug where we get out of sync due to some bad math somewhere. It's definitely much improved.

When I stuff audio data into the buffer because we're running low on samples, I fill it with 0's. That is causing clicks. I should probably decay the signal over time like I saw mentioned in some other projects. Alternatively, fill the buffer with the last value. Let's say we tail it off - multiply by 1 / (time since last event).

Trying the "repeat last sample" method. Now we are still running out of samples in certain cases. One such case is when the emulator window is obscured. like, just click to bring a browser window to completely cover it. Something will have interrupted execution long enough to bring the effective cycles per second to 800khz. It's not bringing it up, it's covering it. The Mac must be doing something weird. Maybe there is a task priority setting; I should learn more about this memory compression business.

Another event that can trigger a buffer underrun is dragging the window to another screen.

## Feb 27, 2025

been programming my brain with NTSC stuff over the last week. I am starting to get a clear picture of it. The section of UTA2 page 8-20 is making sense.

The display emulation in OpenEmulator is the best one I've found. By far the most accurate. It processes in a number of steps. First, it creates a bitmap of 1/0 signal that is delayed or undelayed in a 560x192 grid. Good, that's basically what I came up with, though it generates it a little differently than I did. But that difference doesn't matter.
Two, it then applies a number of shaders to that data. A shader is just a small function/program that runs inside a GPU. OE is using the OpenGL 3D API to run shaders. It has shaders that do all kinds of crazy stuff, like project the display onto a curved surface of a simulated CRT tube, handle brightness and color hue controls, etc. I'm not interested in going that crazy, as I think those effects interfere with the usability of the emulator. (Though, they accurately simulate how frustrating it was to use computers on cheap monitors in the 1980s!)
The basic shader in OE though compares a phase signal to the bit pattern to calculate the color of each pixels, and, also performs multiple samples of each pixel at slightly different places to simulate blur that occurs because an old CRT can't shift its beams around very fast. (It is this that causes 010101 to generate solid green for instance even though every other pixel is off, and, that shows alternating green and black stripes on screen on a high-frequency-response CRT like the AppleColor RGB on the IIgs.)
I've got a utility program that can read a hires file and output a PPM image of the display (PGM, as it's in grayscale right now). Next step is to apply the logic from the shaders and see if I can get a good color output.

## Mar 6, 2025

Finally, success!! There were a few issues with the ./comp version of the openemulator display code. First, -33 needed to be coded as +33 offset. Second, the matrices in the openemulator code were transposed (row/column) from the perspective of my matrix multiply routines, at least. Flipping that fixed a bunch of issues. Finally, the C++ code that applied the filters was not right. Claude identified it was not looking at the neighboring pixels correctly. Once fixed, I am successfully convering hi-res data files into composite-style images!

They look really good.

Next step is to clean up the code, modularize it, make it so it can be a library. Then see if there are obvious optimizations that can be made to speed it up for emulator purposes. I don't know if it will be fast enough. But we can test and give it the old college try!

Added some hot keys to dump the hires and text pages to files.

Added support to hot-mount disk images into the 3.5 drives in slot 5, and display their icons.

## Mar 9, 2025

there are some double hires pictures in /asimov/images/productivity/graphics/misc/picpacdoubleres.dsk
They are, however, compressed somehow. 

Got some info on forcing a cold start reset:

$3f2/3f3 hold the warmstart vector. $3f4 is the "checksum"; if $3F3 XOR'd with $a5 is equal to $3f4, then do a warmstart.

So on ctrl-alt-F10 (reset) set $3f2-$3f4 to $00 $00 $00. 

A remaining speaker issue - certain things cause the cpu to halt, but the speaker code is still running and then I'm not sure what happens.
This occurs on invalid opcodes as well as "infinite jump" loops.

So on a halt we stop executing code. But perhaps should continue to increment the cycle counter like we expect..
on a reset, we restart the cpu but the audio code is then out of sync. ok incrementing cycle counter anyway (based on expected cycles) is working there.

Our audio beeps are very buzzy. We're not filtering the audio in any way.

On the Mac, "App Nap" changes execution priority, probably triggers memory unloading / compression etc., when an app is not the foreground. There are ways to disable this - you can set a flag via finder, and you can do it programmatically. The latter Claude says requires tying in to Objective C - erk why? 

It does not seem like App Nap is the culprit. When I flagellate a Alacritty window over top, it doesn't cause the same issues as using a Cursor window.
Hinting to use opengl, cause the problem a lot less also, though opengl itself is slower than metal. Keep an eye on it.

Created some abstractions for a SystemConfig. This is the selection of a platform, and a list of devices and their slots. Currently pre-define several of these, with only an Apple II+ fully speced out. Eventually, default configs for each type of system will be here, and, users will be able to clone, customize, load and save their own configs.

As part of this, the OSD now displays the name of the card in each slot that has one.

This also cleans up the init code in gs2.cpp, which now iterates through the data structure to initialize devices. Next step is to gracefully de-initialize them on exit. And then, we'll have the framework we need to support powering a system on and off, and changing config at runtime.

I've never been thrilled with the prodos block implementation. It relies on "ParaVirtualization" - something performs a JSR to a particular address, then we trap that in the CPU instruction execution loop and call a handler. Currently, this address is hardcoded in that loop, so the device in question is hard-wired to a specific slot.

I also just thought about a weakness in the design of devices, how we store state information in a block identified by an ID assigned to the device. This will prevent us from having multiple instances of the same device type in different slots. Is that something people care about in an emulator? Is there anything out there that requires having two Disk II controllers / 4 drives? Old timey BBS might have had a setup like that, but in emulatorville everyone gets a free hard drive, so.. The obvious solution is to use new slot data structure to store that data. 

I am also going to make the following changes to the build system to simplify the process. We currently have system dependencies on python, and as65 from Brutal Deluxe.

* Populate system ROMs into the assets directory
* Firmware we build will be in separate projects.
  * For instance: ProDOS Block firmware; system roms download and combine.
  * These are copied into resources/roms; and resources/cards. These files then stored in repo.
  * Such firmware will be loaded like any other ROM image asset.
  * Then we can just distribute the ROMs with the main gs2 source code.

Instead of putting roms in assets, we have the roms/ directory in the project root. So this is where they go. They are copied from here into resources/roms and Resources/roms on build-package.

This will greatly simplify other people building.

What is distinction between assets and resources? Assets is predominately image data; perhaps also sound data eventually. Resources are things like ROMs, and other data that is not user-visible.

Do I need this distinction? Let's put ROMs in assets. These are "inputs". They are processed. Then copied into the Resources directory.

Resources is either: *.app/Contents/Resources/ on Mac, or ./resources/ on Linux (or Mac when run from the command line).

The system ROMs; should I bother combining them? Why not just load them individually and directly in the code? We now have the handy routine to make it easy to load ROM and other asset files.

ok the new pdblock2 device is working. This eliminates the poorly thought-out Paravirtualization stuff. Maybe in the future we can do this better - for example, this could let us PV DOS33 RWTS routines so DOS33 could use super-fast disk access.

I did not properly implement the PD_STATUS command. It wants A=0, X/Y = number of blocks on device, and CLC. 

```
LDA ERR,X
PHA
LDA STATUS1,X
PHA
LDA STATUS2,X
TAX
PLA
TAY
PLA
CMP
RTS
```

This will let us return the correct number of blocks on the device (something the old PV wasn't even doing).

Interestingly, if no disk is mounted, PD_STATUS does return an error 0x28 and trying to boot with c500g causes it to jump to BASIC. However, if it's unmounted and you do PR#5, it retries in an infinite loop to boot. Weird. Is that because it's constantly trying to output data and thus calling the boot routine over and over?

Double-check to make sure we can't mount a disk that is not 140K onto a disk ii.

## Mar 16, 2025

```
<> Media Descriptor: /Users/bazyar/src/gssquared/newdisk.nib
  Media Type: PRE-NYBBLE
  Interleave: NONE
  Block Size: 256
  Block Count: 560
  File Size: 232960
  Data Offset: 0
  Write Protected: No
  DOS 3.3 Volume: 254
Disk image is not 140K
```

The size check I added to diskII mount fails on anything except a raw 140K disk image. Media Descriptor should populate Data Size. OK that's fixed, and I fixed a bug where trying to mount a .nib wasn't setting all the right properties.

I still see the occasional issue where booting dos3.3, trying to catalog,s6,d2, drive 1 lights up instead of drive 2. Reset then do it again, and it works.

Doing a little thinking about how we might handle demos that change screen modes in tight cycle loops to create interesting (albeit useless) effects. Instead of immediately changing screen mode variables, we could post an event to a queue. Then when we render a video frame, do it scanline by scanline regardless of mode. And keep track of the events, switching modes as we go. This is a fair bit of work to get a couple of demos working that if you want you can watch in OE or another emulator. I think the question will come down to, do any actual useful programs (games, etc.) do these tricks.

## Mar 18, 2025

thinking about data flow for OSD. Storage devices should Register with the OSD. either the OSD, or the Mount Manager. Mount Manager can be a standalone thing. OSD then uses Mounts to get drive / disk status etc. Currently the disk buttons / status are manually called (by name). so use Mount as an abstraction for both. Ultimately other things in the system might want drive info.
Device init registers. Device de-init de-registers with Mounts.

Going to dive into debugging ProDOS 2.4.3 hanging on boot. It's getting stuck in a loop around $D380-$D3FF. There are two loops.
The first is this:

```

```

That is code loading a value from the disk and looking for the marker $D5.

And then later it's spinning around here:

```

it's updating a variable at $D36F. there are some other vars here too. 

Short version, it's scanning track data and not getting what it is expecting.
ok the track is starting at 0 and it's hammering it CHUGGA style. About 35 times as we'd expect. This is the C600 boot loader here.
we get to real track 5 (done loading prodos) and then it jumps into D1xx. 
Then it's jumping back and forth between track 1 halftracks 0 and 1.

So is it doing that to try to rehome on the track, or, are my disk2 register emulation not working as expected?

It's cycling doing :
* turn off all phases 
* ph1 on
* ph2 off
* ph0 on
* ph1 off
* turn off all phases

repeat.

OpenEmulator won't boot my image.nib. 

looking at my output .nib, first difference is AppleSauce is using Volume 001, whereas I'm using volume 254.
Second thing, my sector order/numbers are wrong. 

It was track 0 sector 1 as 03 00 05 00 ...
I have it as all 0's.
My sector that has 03 00 05 00 is marked as Sector E.

So I am generating the sectors incorrectly. The boot code is working ok for whatever reason, but when it switches to the ProDOS 2.4.3 code it barfs.

First thing to try, is use Volume 001 like a ProDOS disk should.

If Interleave = ProDOS, use volume 1.
Oh, nibblizer is not using the media descriptor thing and is manually generating DOS33 interleave and volume 254. Ergh.
ok, nibblizer is fixed. It converts a .po image to a .nib and this boots in OE. Also boots in Virtual2.
The volume deal did not fix ProDOS 243.

I did confirm with nibblizer that we are generating the right interleave etc. So it must think it's on the wrong track. Or it is on the wrong track. The phase cycling above is the indication.

## Mar 28, 2025

ok, I got some source snippets for these routines. John mentioned a couple possibilities. First, if we don't get an address field in 2000 nybbles then we generate a RDERR - this is a branch to $D3FB. I am not executing that.

The code being hit is the "fast seek routine".

It's the "fast seek" routine that keeps cycling over and over. It is trying to seek back to track 0, starting at halftrack A. However, it gets to halftrack 1 and then sticks there.
CURTRK starts at 0, and TRKN is also 0.

```

Current track is A. Desired track is 0. We go from this to:
```

```
track 5 to track 1?
How did D35A change to that in one call to JSR SEEK?
ok look at this...

```
 | PC: $0975, A: $65, X: $65, Y: $20, P: $20, S: $A1 || 0975: LDA $C080,XPH: slot 6, drive 0, phase 2, onoff 1

new (internal track): 10, realtrack 5, halftrack 0
```

The first step we are going in the wrong direction a half track. Then when we end all these seeks we end up at track 1 (02) instead of 0.
I wonder if it's got code somewhere I'm not seeing that reads the track number from the disk to update CURTRK. Yes, at D171 it takes the read TRACK number and calls CLRPHASE.

Is it possible that from the first to 2nd step we're not decremending the track number when we should? A half track down from track 5/0 is track 4/1, not 5/1. No, we count in half-tracks.

```

when we turn phase 1 on on that 3rd from last line, the code says:

```
case DiskII_Ph1_On:
            if (DEBUG(DEBUG_DISKII)) DEBUG_PH(slot, drive, 1, 1);
            if (last_phase_on ==2) {
                seldrive.track--;
            } else if (last_phase_on == 0) {
                seldrive.track++;
            }
            seldrive.phase1 = 1;
            seldrive.last_phase_on = 1;
            break;
```
the last phase on was 0 (first line) so we increment the track - which is probably wrong.

UTA2 - "Even numbered tracks are phase-0 aligned, and odd-numbered tracks are phase-2 aligned".
This means that if we're on track 5, we're aligned with phase 2, which means turning on phase 1 will DECREMENT the track.
ok so instead of using "last phase" . last phase is not indicative necessarily. because we might be *changing direction* of movement.

Dude, that is working.

So, I see one of the "acceleration" things people talk about is probably setting all the prodos timer values to low numbers for track seeking, the phase on-off tables at $D373. We could detect when ProDOS is loaded and running and then set those variables to all be 1 or something, to minimize the amount of waiting around for a virtual disk head to move.

## Mar 29, 2025

I have two major pieces to do at the Apple II Plus stage:
* Writing to floppy images.
* Videx VideoTerm 80-column support.

I might want to take a stab at returning reasonable value for "floating bus reads". Doesn't seem to be preventing anything from working right now though.

See DiskII.md for notes on writing to floppy images.

Working on hgrdecode for dhgr. I have the pixels correct. However, the colors are wrong. Green becomes blue. orange becomes green. purple becomes red/yellow. blue becomes purple.
So the phase is just off by 90 degrees ish. Are we off by one bit position? It's 90 degrees off. that is one bit. If I insert an extra blank bit at the start of each scanline then the colors are correct. But that's not right... In the diagram in UTA2E it shows the Auxiliary byte coming in before the hgr bytes in the other examples for single hires? I don't understand.. One fix is to simply change the phase. But something is off here. It could well be the sample files? I need to do some paid work now!
There is something fonky in the OE where it's blowing off the last bit of pixel data?

this is at the end of drawHires80:
  if (x==39) {
      blank80Segment(p+CELL_WIDTH);
  }
"blank an 8 pixel segment".

ok, this is because the whole display is shifted left by one byte position (one 80 column char, or one dhgr byte) when in 80-column mode. It does start a byte early, so the phase is going to be shifted here because it starts early.

Something's not right here. And maybe it's the core - remember how I shifted negative colorburst to positive colorburst? Maybe that was covering up some other problem, and now I'm wrong by about 90 degrees.

Double hi-res uses four bits per pixel. 16 colors. How does it "get started" - i.e., does it start with 3 blank bits and 1 data bit? Or does it clock in data bits first before displaying a color? Maybe that's the pre-shift I see in the diagram in UTA2E.

Nick Westgate: "IIRC, all double resolution modes start one byte before all normal resolution modes."
So that explains the stuff to the left of the diagram on page 10 of UTA2E.

Also, UTA2E says the video ROM lookup inverts all the bits going out to video in hires modes. WHAT?!

Maybe it's not +1.. but -7?  (or -6).

Each byte in the diagram is a 90 degree shift? 

So tweak phase to start at 0.25 (90 degrees). problem solved.

## Mar 30, 2025

tweak to hgrdecode to make it start with phase difference of 90 degrees for doublehires.

Implemented write-protect detection on image files in Disk II. Still need to implement that in pdblock2. A nice workflow. If a file is erroneously WPd, you can unmount, change the FS bit, then re-mount. Voila!

Need to change the OSD so when I click on a mounted disk, it unmounts it. Then a separate click, to mount anew.

## Mar 31, 2025

Instead of setting a flag to raise the window, let's use an event queue structure. I was thinking we'd use this to manage the disk drive sound sample stuff.

Let's make a little test program to play sound samples. That was easy, sheesh.

To simulate disk sounds: the motor on sound is easy, just keep playing the same audio data in. Head movement: it seems like we want to play the whole track sound, but, if we determine the head has -stopped- moving, flush it at that point. Have to come up with some appropriate hueristic for "stopped moving" (for example, hasn't moved in 1/60th second?) The bump "stop" sound should be a "one and done", we play it, then forget it. 

Looking at the existing speaker code with this example code in consideration, I now see that I don't HAVE TO send it constant data including empty frames. I -can- just feed it data when I have it. It will fill with silence otherwise. And, if I decay my values (going from + or - to 0) in a reasonable time, then there won't be clicks when that occurs. Something to think about..

I should also move the general audio subsystem init into its own file, util/sound.cpp. Then the various things that need to emit sound will reference that. When we get to the GS, we'll need lots of AudioStreams (one for each "voice" of the Ensoniq chip).

## April 1, 2025

We need to somehow detect multi-track head movements. One track at a time sounds right. But when the head swoops across a big area we need to play successive chunks of the sound, not simply repeat the first bit of the sound for each track moved.

I think we need more border. I would like to draw disk drives in the margin when they're running, so more border will help. Draw them with maybe 50% opacity. And draw using a Container. Instantiate new Disk II / Unidisk buttons. And the container needs to be dynamically managed to contain only actively spinning media. Have the opacity fade in and fade out.

Trying to format a 5.25 with ProDOS 1.1.1 filer, I get the error "Disk II drive too slow". That is special.
DOS33 is doing an INIT. I guess we'll see what it looks like in AppleSauce!
Well it looks ok to me. 

The DiskII "wrong drive thing"... this is what we do.

MOT: slot 6, drive 0, motor 1
DS:slot 6, drive 0, drive_select 1
PH: slot 6, drive 1, phase 1, onoff 1

turns on the motor, then does drive select 1. apparently, this is supposed to switch the motor to drive 1.

FIXED!

Well, well. You can write to the drive select and drive on/off registers, and, locksmith does that. Locksmith is now validating disks.

A format isn't working right. And maybe my DOS3.3 format didn't actually work right, but are they verified when you do an INIT? Unsure. This is likely going to be caused by not fake rotating the fake disk under the fake head even when we're not doing anything. I could try reenabling that code...

OK, still have problems initializing disks. I'm only modifying track position on reads. That's an issue. So need to bring that code out to the top of the disk II registers routine. So any time we hit a register we're updating.

Call me crazy, the dos33 system master boot seems faster.. well it's not working right.

I bet on inits, this thing is trying to write 10-bit FFs. and here in a sector header we have..

FF FF FF FF D5 AA 96 FF FE AA AA AF AF FA FB DE AA EB E7 FF FF FF FF FF D5 AA AD 96 96....

DE AA EB E7 FF ?

That E7 is supposed to be an FF.

here's another broken one:
FF96FF
that's after a sector, it ought to be FF.

ok, will have to study the cycle timing on writes. 

## Apr 2, 2025

Writing a self-sync 

Proposal: read or write a bit at a time.
on read: set "bitsleft" to 10 if FF. otherwise to 8. So we actually feed emulated DOS 2 zero bits on a read.
on write: we're not going to store the 0 bits, so just set it to 8.

I have made the following tweaks: increment the disk 'head' position by one BEFORE a write. An init is working and can save the file, however, I am getting extraneous 96 after the newly written data fields. Before, I was getting the last byte of the address field chopped off - that was creating I/O errors.

(I may have to go ahead and implement this sequencer state machine.)

ProDOS still not working, filer reports "disk ii drive too slow".

So, what if that is ProDOS complaining that there are too many bytes in Gap A? This whole 0x1A00 thing is a suggestion, not a command.. let's measure how many bytes we are actually generating from our conversion.
yes. So comparing to an AppleSauce conversion to nibblized, we have 2100 more bits, 360 more nibbles, and duration of 208200us versus 199997us. 300rpm is 5 rotations per second is 200,000us. So, we need to actually mark how much data we write, and then use THAT as, um, track_data_size.
I am generating a track.size. So let's use it..
ProDOS still no likey, however, disk stuff ought to be up to 5% faster since we cut 300 bytes out of 6000. DOS read, write, init is working ok still.

Comment from Nick Westgate:
ProDOS will have something similar to what I mentioned in a previous comment: [For DOS] you need to provide at least one different nibble in every 16 nibbles to defeat the SAMESLOT drive speed check in DOS/RWTS at BD34-BD53 (according to Beneath Apple DOS). ProDOS is different though IIRC.

that's not it.

However, I am starting to think ProDOS is doing something not mentioned in manuals. 

## Apr 4, 2025

Thanks to a tip from Nelson, forcing a disk image track to be fewer bytes (reducing GAP A when generating nibblized version for instance) makes ProDOS Format work.
But now DOS 3.3 format does not. I reduced from 149 to 64 bytes. Let's increase a bit..

Final update: Many thanks to Nelson Waissman who put me on the right ... track ... ha ha pun intended. The number of nibbles in the virtual disk track determine the "speed" the disk is spinning. 
If too short, DOS3.3 won't format. (not enough room for how DOS33 init's a track!)
If too long, ProDOS thinks the disk is too slow.
His number of 0x18D0 is exactly right.

Locksmith now: Verify 16 sector ok; Format 16 sector ok; it cannot bit-copy. It keeps complaining about "FRAME BITS 02, LONGSS #FB02". run locksmith disk speed thing. Still reports the disk is really really slow.
ProDOS now: format volume ok and can copy files to it;
DOS3.3 now: init volume ok and can write files to it.
DOS33 and ProDOS 2.4.3 format, disk copy, etc with CopyIIPlus- works.
Copy II Plus drive speed test - doesn't work.

Proposed task list for next release (0.20)
* finish up Disk II write by denibblizing (if needed) and writing disk II data back to disk file.
* clean up video code so we call old monochrome hires code in that mode. [ complete ]
* Center display in window when in fullscreen mode. [ complete ]
* Redo joystick code so it maps correctly when it comes online after emu start. (sometimes starts with Y reversed!, or not right joystick at all)
* Decay the audio so we don't get so many annoying clicks due to OS interrupting my event loops [ complete ]

That ought to be easy!

## Apr 5, 2025

building on windows - Win doesn't like strndup because it's a POSIX function. Find a standard c++ library alternative.
and really do some cleanup, use C++ variants of std library stuff instead of a mishmash of c and c++.

First pass, not awful, though having some issues when linking against SDL. Some weird Windowsism.

on the speaker decay. When we hit an event, set the amplitude to 0x6000. Each sample after that, decay the amplitude 0x0100. (that's about 90 samples, can adjust this). If we fill empty frame, continue using decaying amplitude. Sample value at any point is amplitude * polarity. I currently have it to decay at 0x0300. That doesn't seem to hurt frequency response at all. I also reduced the max amplitude to 0x5000 from 0x6000. 

There is a bug occurring where the display stops updating right when I move the window between screens, sometimes. oh weird. It's when the left edge of the window is near the left edge of the screen?? only my right screen. And, if the left edge is within the first inch or so. What the. Special.

hm, see what events we might be getting when we're close to the window edge.

Time to make the denibblizer!

To be fair, I have denibblizer examples in both the DOS3.3 source code, and, the Disk II boot firmware. How hard could it be?

The basic process for what was block data file:

1. For each track:
   1. Mark 16 "sector found" flags all false.
   2. Start at position 0 in the track. As we scan, we might have to wrap back to the start of track.
   3. Scan until we get to a D5 AA 96 whatever the sector address field marker is.
   4. Extract the sector info.
   5. Scan until we get to a D5 AA AD?
   6. Read 342 nibbles into denibblizer buffer
   7. Decode buffer and validate checksum
   8. Copy decoded buffer into track block buffer with offset based on track X + sector Y * 256. Will have to take the interleave into account.
   9. Set "sector found" flag for that sector.
   10. If all sectors were found, Write track out to image file 
2. Repeat for all tracks.

### For the user-interface:

Position an overlay container over OSD:
   * Media FILENAME in SLOT X DRIVE Y was modified! Write changes back to file?
   * YES | DISCARD | CANCEL

Perhaps this will be a Dialog, not a Container?

For this we will draw everything, then draw this on top (it will always be after all other containers), and direct input events only to this container. (it is a modal dialog after all). 

[x] strndup is a posix function. Replace with a C++ convention. (replaced with our own version for windows)

## Apr 6, 2025

OK the denibblizer is done! A lot of my trouble was being tired and mixing up what files were going where so all my testing was bogus. Don't TARRED AND CODE!

Denibblizing in the standalone tool, we need to know what interleave to use on output. We don't have it from raw nibble form. So the user needs to specify it on the command line. either --prodos or --dos33. (-p or -d).

Inside the emulator, we will track the interleave 

Either way it should get passed into the denibblizer routine as a parameter. pass the table, or a flag? 

Audio issue - I still get clicks in the first few minutes after boot when opening/closing the file dialog and causing underruns. So we must still be generating non-zero fills somewhere.

in the OSD code that mounts a disk, it is passing in the char * filename. I bet this is getting deallocated. We better strndup it.

Some additional thoughts:
don't allow unmounting if modified is true and the motor is on? or just punt that and give them UI choice anyway?

OK, the diskII write code is DONE! Works for DOS33, and ProDOS. Writes back to original block format, or, writes back to nibblized file, depending on origin. (i.e., back to original format). There is no UI yet - if you unmount a modified disk, the image WILL BE saved back out if you unmount.

If you don't want to save changes that were written to an image, for now, don't unmount it, just F12 / close the emu which will exit without saving.

## Apr 7, 2025

Added a couple more disk II sound effects (for open door close door). The Unidisk makes all sorts of sounds too. I will have to record those myself! Shouldn't be too hard. But not my priority right now.

I want to clean up and reorganize the display code.

strndup must go. I can make my own implementation and avoid having to refactor all the string code to use std::string.

Or, just bite the bullet and do the right thing. I mean, I really ought to. FINE.

## Apr 8, 2025

So for the modal dialog, stick it smack in the middle of the OSD. Make it 200 x 100 pixels for now. We'll need a modal flag - if set, it is a pointer to the modal container. Updates are requested of that container AFTER everything else is drawn, and, events are exclusively sent to that container instead of the regular container list. Then we can define any number of modals to use for different things. (For example, selecting what card goes into a slot, choosing CPU type, etc.)

DiskIISaveContainer - 
   Save
   Save As
   Discard
   Cancel

The Modal Container needs to somehow return the selection when done.

Also create a FadeOutStatus concept. This is a similar thing. It is a container button that displays for N frames, then decays to nothing over the next D frames. I need the ability to draw a button (text or image) with a forced opacity. I can do it with text. not sure about images. So, if we hit F9 to change speed for instance, the new speed will display at the bottom of the screen for a while. Maybe towards the left edge, to leave room for drives. And to leave room for another status display on the right side, to show effective CPU speed, cycles, etc. whatever we want over there.

OK, I do want to create a sub-type of Container, that is ModalContainer. It will accept another Constructor argument, the Msg Text. This is displayed without being a button. It will also lay out its Buttons a certain way (Centered, in one line.). 

ok, that's sort of done.

So when we click to unmount a disk, we are in the middle of an OSD button callback. Since this Modal Dialog needs to display and receive events as part of our main event loop, the button callback can no longer be the code that calls unmount, plays the sound, etc. We need to trigger an event that will cause an appropriate piece of code to be executed from the main event loop. We need an EventQueue.

The EventQueue is a simple ordered (FIFO) queue. we push an event onto it. We push:

EventQueue
    Event
        uint64_t timestamp
        event_id enum (one of defined set of events)
        event_callback ( function to call with event )
        event_data ( additional data to pass with event )

We can have a variety of Event subclasses, one for each type of event. (This is how we should have done the cpu module data stuff, and, still can, if we REFACTOR!)

So here's the overall flow.
OSD is up.
Disk button is clicked.
Disk button issues DiskIIClickEvent, with data of 'key'. (i.e., ID of disk drive).

1. ModalShowEvent first shows the modal (some of its data specifies which modal).
1. All the buttons in the ModalContainer have (same) callback that will issue a ModalClickEvent with the button ID.
1. ModalClickEvent sends the click info to the Event handler of the current modal (in this case, ModalClickEvent).
1. It then takes appropriate action to make the modal go away.

So the Modal has two event handler routines? an SDL_event handler and a gs2 Event handler. (Container only has the one type of event handler).

Other Event types:
* Play standalone Sound Effect

SDL allows user-defined events. However, that would require use of void * and other horsepuckey. Implementing one ourselves is no biggie. So let's do it.

Or is this overwrought? I could just store the key in the DiskIIModal and let it handle state itself.
OTOH, the EventQueue idea lets us queue up several events. Say, on a Quit - we have multiple modified disks, we need to ask about each one. We can queue the events all at once. We could also pass the Events to a separate thread to handle stuff that might take a while to execute.

Lot of flexibility for what is a small amount of work. Go for it!

Does it go into UI? Or into util? Base class goes into Util. UI-related child classes go into UI.

on a modal button click, get the button ID from the button itself.

OK this is working well!

Looking at the goof going on with the game controller stuff. After ludicrous speed, it just stops working. This may be a SDL thing (polling the joysticks too frequently?)
There is another issue, the IIe reference manual says "Addressing $C07X" resets all four timers. This implies reads and writes. Also, it's clear that it is C07X. So all of those should do the same strobe reset.

## Apr 9, 2025

tweaking layout of the modal - (auto) centering stuff. centering text in buttons. That also affected the slot buttons, but, those can be their own type later, or, can specify a style element for text alignment.

Current Apple II+ todo list:

* Video Videoterm
* finish refactoring video code so we have three modes: composite, RGB, monochrome.

Mono: the raw bits placed into the 560x192 video buffer, without any color processing.
'RGB': the first-generation color stuff.
Composite: the next-generation color stuff.

First step is to implement Composite for lo-res, and then also text.

So let's do it!

ok, I now have lores wired into Composite (NG), and, mono Lo-res as well! I see that the lo-res colors are WAY different between the Comp and RGB code. That's what you get for trusting the internet!

So from a user interface perspective, I think there are a number of dimensions.

Color Engine: Composite or RGB
Color Mode: Color or Mono
Pixel Mode: Pixel-Perfect or Fuzz
Mono Color: Green, Amber, White

I was previously thinking like:

Color, Green, Amber, White  |  Comp , RGB  | Fuzz, Square

What if we want White mono as well?

So the difference here is really just, four controls or three. With mono, there are no artifacts. So it really is a distinct mode from Comp and RGB?

It doesn't make sense to have a Comp Amber or an RGB amber. They're the same.

So:

Comp, RGB, Mono | Green, Amber, White | Fuzz, Square

These various combos of the four rendering variables. Refactoring the mode definitions and variables now.

Experimenting with a different aspect ratio - this multiplies the vertical by another 1.22 (making the initial ratio 2 / 4.9). This makes the Sather book square example actually square.

#define SCALE_X 2
#define SCALE_Y 4.9

I got so used to the current way that I'm not sure how I feel about this. Everything works just fine with it, though, it is quite large. I might have to shrink it a bit, i.e. go with 1.5 x something? Seems to look ok with the fuzzy scaling. top and bottom borders would need to be adjusted.

## Apr 10, 2025

Been thinking about creating new blank disk images. It would be easy enough to have a button in the control panel to create a new blank disk image. Save As.. to save to a file. Then you can mount straight away! Basically we'll just have some blank disk images in resources/ and copy them as needed.

Next step is to do text via the same routines! This will involve refactoring the text font drawing stuff - but not much. let's see how I prepare the font.. it creates a map of 32-bit pixels. We don't need that. We would actually just need 8-bit pixels, same as ever, either 0x00 or 0xFF to feed into the new graphics routines.

text rendering then will have two modes: color and mono:
when in RGB display mode, text is drawn in mono white.
When in composite mode, it's drawn as if it was graphics and run through the LUT.
When in mono mode, it's drawn in mono white, green, or amber accordingly.

## Apr 11, 2025

current render_line conditionals are a mess with lots of repeated bits. Let's take a stab at fixing..

I think at a high level, we should do this.

The pixel mode (linear or etc) is independent.

```
if color_engine = NTSC
   LORES: lores_ng
   HIRES: hires_ng
   TEXT: text_ng
   (all) renderflag = NTSC
else if color_engine = RGB
   LORES: lores-rgb. renderflag = RGB
   HIRES: hires-rgb. renderflag = RGB
   TEXT: text_ng. renderflag = NTSC

if (renderflag = RGB) we're done, return.

if (mono || text-mode-only)
   ng_mono with selected mono color.
if (color)
   ng_color_LUT.

return.
```

Well, I can't put it off any longer. I am at the point where I include a Video VideoTerm, or punt on it for now. Let's release current code as Version 0.2.0, and then include Videx into a 0.3.

I'm monkeying with a Windows build again. 

1. go ahead and accept the replacement strndup in a header (strndup.h)
2. add #include sdl3/sdl_main to gs2.cpp.
3. soundeffects.cpp - there is an unneeded include sdl_main here. eliminate it.

Then, rip out the old prodos_block code, and move its firmware construction to the src/gs2_firmware build tree, and clean that bit out. I think that's confusing cmake on windows later. Also, it won't work because I don't have the assembler on there.

When disk drive is running (e.g., when in boot mode with no floppy in drive), and in free-run mode, effective CPU rate drops by 40% to 50%. (Issue #25).

It's not the OSD, I commented that out. So it must just be the disk code itself. It's probably this: the disk read routines are in an extremely tight loop just hammering on the read register. That is executing the C0XX read routine quite a lot.
commenting-out the debugs added about 10MHz effective.
This isn't a general problem with the disk code. If I cut out the disk handling altogether by putting "return 0xEE" at the top of the handler, it makes no difference!
Sitting in the keyboard loop we get 425MHz. So, maybe it's the thing that dispatches the slot I/O locations generally?
Should do some general-purpose profiling..
if I read C0e8 in a super-tight loop, I have nothing. So what else is the disk ii boot code doing? well, it -is- running in c600.

Running the Disk II boot code at $1600 (1600 < C600.C6FFM ) speed slows down to only 350MHz.

Tests:
* sitting idle in keyboard loop: 410 - 420
* Booting via C600: 270
* Boot code copied into RAM at 1600: 350

So first off, the the thing that handles I/O memory areas is on the slow side.
Second, something in the 6502 emu in the disk loop is slow - maybe it's indirect X. It's likely sitting in this bit waiting for a D5 that will never come:

```
LDA $C08C,X
BPL $165E
EOR #$D5
```

I turned incr_cycles into a macro. Speed went from 270 to 315MHz during boot. 597MHz when keyboard idle. (Whoa. That was a huge improvement.) That was simply getting rid of a subroutine call.

I should add time instrumentation to the cpu loop too. btw each cpu loop iteration is a subroutine call. There are some other questionable bits of code in the cpu here:

```
uint8_t read_byte_from_pc
  uint8_t read_byte(cpu_state *cpu, uint16_t address)
    uint8_t value = read_memory(cpu, address);
```

none of these are inlines. I should try that.. made no difference. The compiler must have already been optimizing them out.

[ ] bug: when you run the apple ii graphics demo (bob bishop image waterfall thing) in ludicrous speed, way too many disk sounds get queued up. WAY. they keep playing forever. Maybe clean the soundeffect queues on a ctrl-reset? Or, disable disk soundeffects in ludicrous speed?

## Apr 13, 2025

Thinking about keyboard shortcuts. I really like Control-F10 (or whatever similar) for control-reset. However, by default on a MacBook, the touchbar shows media keys, brightness, etc. You can configure it to default to F1-F12 and hold Fn to get media functions. So, workable. But it might be cool to set special touchbar keys for GS2. For instance, we could have RESET, keys for the different display modes, etc. I have a bit of sample code in the repo now that purports to program/modify the touch bar. Haven't tested it yet, but will do shortly.

* clang++ -x objective-c++ -std=c++17 -framework Cocoa -framework AppKit src/platform-specific/macos/TouchBarHandler.mm -o TouchBarHandler.o -c

now that doesn't help my windows laptop. It doesn't have that. but it does have prt sc, home, end, insert, delete where the function keys ought to be. So, could use ctrl-del for instance for ctrl-reset. what about ctrl-alt-delete? hehe. yeah that doesn't work. but could do control-insert. or home. Ahh. Fn-ESC will "lock" the Fn keys. 

Alternatively, have controls at the top of the window. Hover over the top 15-20 scanlines to access those controls (only when mouse isn't captured). You'd have reset, hard reset, crt modes, etc. I'd still have all my keyboard shortcuts, but, then you'd have this control strip.

There are adb to usb converter widgets. People could just use their actual Apple IIgs keyboard! ha!

I could replace a good part of the current OSD stuff with the HUD type stuff.

So let's do the MHz stuff at the bottom like I was talking about. ok. Coo.

how about a debug window?
* on a keypress, open/close the debug window.
* debug window:
   * shows last N disassembled instructions and register status, and memory in/out. (basically the opcode debug).
   * don't use printf. construct these in a character buffer as we go, fixed positions. buffer in cpu struct so various things in cpu all have easy access to it.
   * define macros to set various bits of information as we go.
   * update display each frame like always.
   * have pause, step functions, and a one-instruction-per-second mode. (that's setting clock speed to 1 Hz)
   * allow setting debug flag register via cli (-d XXXX).
   * two areas: disasm output, other debug output.
* at end of instruction, optionally emit the status line to stdout. (if we do, trim whitespace from end of line before output)

So, this is hundreds of thousands of instructions per second, even at 1mhz mode. One million line buffer is maybe 5 seconds worth, and will take 100MB of ram. whoo. Have a key to stop trace and dump to disk. Circular buffer until key hit. I did like the thing in Steve that showed the DISASM there, and if there was a tight loop it would stay in that tight loop.

## Apr 14, 2025

I can no longer avoid the Videx. So: Videx in our same main window, or, Videx in a separate window? Let's do it in the main window for the moment, and auto-switch between it and hgr as necessary. Things I'll need:

* Videx character set (openemulator has these)
* Videx rom (I have this already, also OE has it)

Let's see how OE handles it.. pr#3 turns it on. pr#0 does not turn it off (reset does). I'm not sure there's much software that is going to work with this.. some word processors. AppleWorks if you hack it.

Is there anything left I need to do for the II+? I'm not sure there is. Maybe move along to the unenhanced IIe?

or, do a fun little thing, implement a 320x200 VGA card. (16 color fits in 32K, and 256 color fits in 64k). Could do a bank switching thing, or have it work like the slinky card. Or something more like the Second Sight, with a coprocessor on it. Could implement all sorts of drawing primitives. Support mixed text/vga mode. Would need some software to go along with it. What would be a cool demo? Do something that could actually be implemented on a real card. So there are existing cards. What about the A2DVI ? It's in a position to do what we need.. 

## Apr 15, 2025

All Videx characater rom files are 2KB. each matrix in the rom is 8 pixels by 16 pixels. 

so the Videx rom "ultra.bin" contains the regular char set in the 1st half, and 7x12 character set in the 2nd half of the ROM. (2K per half). The characters are actually 8 x 12. The first column of each character is usually blank, to provide spacing between chars, unless it's a graphics character.

So, 80x18 screen this way is: 640 x 216 pixels. 24 x 9 (normal) is also 640 x 216 pixels. The ultraterm has a 132 column mode, but the VideoTerm does not. honestly, that might be really cool later on..

Have the basic model in there. however when I pr#3 C800 gets overwritten with 0x20. It's trying to clear the screen, but writing to the wrong memory. I was pointing CC and CD to the rom memory. ok, now I pr#3 and shit happens!

Control-G gives the modifed Videx beep. Hey, this is progress! So the firmware is running. And I'm not overwriting it, ha ha.

This is coming together pretty fast. there were a few minor issues, having the hi/lo of the start of frame reversed was a big one. not looking up the characters in the right place another. All minor stuff. I am successfully viewing 80-col text through the Videx firmware/hardware!

things to do:
* we are doing an awkward scale. it's not super-awful. But, it would be much better if we weren't scaling 216->192 and 640->560. oh yeah, that's WAY better. well I only get 7 1/2 of the last 10 characters. oopsie. I will have to resize the window when we're in this mode. (I went ahead and scaled this to fit inside the normal display area of the window. Probably how it would have looked on an Apple II? I don't have a real one to try.)
* needs a cursor. Shouldn't be hard, just need to apply the inversion as specified by the cursor control registers. (done)
* 18-line mode. with the much nicer tall 9x12 characters. (videx 2.4 stopped supporting this. I wonder why? Anyway, drop it) (done)

I might be doing something wrong on the drawing yet. Compare to openemulator.

Well let's think about this. I will need 640 pixels wide when apple iigs is in super hires modes. So I will need to resize window for that too. And SHR cannot mix-mode text.
ok so I want to resize it to borders (maybe bit smaller borders?) plus 640 plus 216.
I want to keep the same scaling factors I have now, 2:4 basically. 

amping up the brightness of the result by using ADD blend mode and doing the texture render twice, brings the brightness up to a good level. very readable. ADD - increase brightness. Multiply - increase contrast.

Things to do:

* optimize by only updating lines that need it (done)
* have update_display call a different render_line just for this purpose (done)
* the cursor on/off stuff needs to be pulled up into update_display. update_display is called only once each 60th second. (done)
* consider whether we should have a update_display hook. We will need the same thing for Apple IIgs super hi-res modes. Maybe Apple III. i.e., this would replace the usual update_display with alternative update_display. Having the update routine for Videx in the Videx file would be a big style improvement. (done)

This would be for things that completely replace the normal update_display logic (VideoTerm, )

VideoTerm needs a line-at-a-time optimization. And support to redraw the line the cursor is on. But that is based on:

* video memory update (done)
* cursor blink status update (done)
* screen memory start position update (done)
* alternate character set. not a register. must be a bit flag in video mem. (yes, high bit.) (done)
* blink rate is not working correctly. supposed to be bit 5. (done)

* shift-key mod

tested: blink / non-blink. cursor start and cursor end.

alt: control-Z 2 standard; control-Z 3 alternate. Switches to garbage. Ah ha. High-bit set is another 2048 bytes of video data. So, allocate 4K for font, load the ROMs, but copy the ROM data into the char set map.

Working on optimizing the display updates. I need to know when we write to pages CC and CD, whenever slot 3 I/O memory is switched in. 
We also have a dirty hack in other code that checks for accesses to mobo video memory to flag those lines as dirty. So, go ahead and hack this, we need to fix it up later.

ok, good enough to ship the code to repo.

Mockingboard is coming together!

I think the envelope is phasing in a little slowly though. You can hear it on certain notes in the music box dancer song. 
Alternate doesn't seem to work. wait, it is working with continue and attack=n and hold=y.

OK, that has been fixed. The envelopes all work correctly according to the data sheet; that's better than Virtual II, whose emulation here does not seem very good.

I should be testing on AppleWin, too..

## Apr 24, 2025

some improvements to the audio generation, primarily due to filtering on each channel before mixing, based on the selected frequency. but apparently I broke noise generation in the last couple commits. oops. There's the IF statement that checks, I did change it from volume to checking a bunch of flags, that's almost certainly where the noise has gone. ok, fixed!!

Still need to fix the volume / compression. As voices come and go there are pretty disjointed discontinuities in overall volume. I like the idea of doing dynamic gain control based on recent max samples. But we don't want to lose dynamic range. So maybe the closer we get to 1.0, the more we should compress, and do it more the closer we get. That's where that tanh thing comes in, I think, but that really harshed the sound.

Also, need to implement the logarithmic volume. Linear just isn't right.

Maybe the thing to do here is deal with stereo. That will reduce the number of channels we're mixing. Chip 0 is left, Chip 1 is right. We can create a SDL stereo audio stream, and pass in two. We mix each chip separately, then chuck each chip's mixed audio into its own SDL audio channel.

So in this order:
* do logarithmic volume
* verify what volume my float samples should be (i.e. scale gain appropriately - we are WAY louder than e.g. virtual 2)
* split the mix into two stereo channels
* tweak the mixing algorithm from there.

Also, create something to log and record the chip events so we can play them back from saved files later with a CLI util. The CLI util should allow playing a saved clip, and, just generating a WAV file.

It may be the case that they just had to be careful not to overload the output channel by playing 3 tones at the same time at loud volume? Who the heck knows how the OS mixes all this stuff, or the SDL layer.

There is maybe another option here, and that is to use some separate signal generator. Would SDL or the OS have a waveform generator? Or use a SIN wave generator? (would have less harmonic stuff to deal with but would probably lose its 80s 8-bit character.) 

btw the Mockingboard manual RTF I have confirms the registers are 0 through 13, with 14 and 15 being unused or "not significant". Contradicts the data sheet. But, it's right.

Each 6522 has two timers, T1 and T2. when they count down to zero, they trigger an interrupt. the GS is going to have stuff like this too, and, in order to be accurate, it will need to count down while we execute CPU cycles and trigger the IRQ while we're in the CPU loop.

Since these are simple counters, each time we tick a cpu cycle we just need to tick these counters as well. So we need to 'register' a clock whenever ..
alternatively, we could register an event to occur. e.g., we know when the next zero crossing will occur. there is an ordered queue of items to call whenever the cpu ticks over to that cycle. If the user reads the current counter, we can just calculate from the last zero crossing. This way we're not calling functions every clock cycle. We're essentially doing it by math any given cycle we only need to check one uint64 to see if we 'got there'. this will work sorta like we track events in speaker.cpp; except we need to maintain an ordered queue. (speaker.cpp events are always ordered, it's a FIFO).

if envelope is 0 and tone amplitude is zero, we're still playing a note. that's wrong.. oh except tone amplitude in this program means "use the envelope". So, the envelope is still playing even if env_period=0.

Logarithmic volume lookup table: done.
I am using a gain of 0.6, built into the lookup table.
split into stereo channels - done. And it causes less weirdness with the simple "divisor mix" in the output, since at any given time there's a max of 3 channels being mixed instead of six.
Also applying the gain of 0.6 seems to help overall results.
Should do much more 

Now I will need to analyze the sample generation window stuff. Let this just sit here over lunch and see if we get out of sync. though I think I generated based on cpu->cycles / nominal cycles per second. in the event we have clock slips, though, this probably gets out of sync. Also, we may be generating too many samples.
One thing we could do, is if no sound sources are active, don't send samples. then the next time we send samples, we will automatically be in sync.

the end of NY, NY I think is just a buggy demo. everything else is working so well..

yes, it got out of sync just sitting there. There was a delay before sounds started emitting, due to backlog (too much buffered data).

There is apparently some technique for auto-detecting a mockingboard, it's in SkyFox. Some other software lets you select mockingboard version and slot. Will have to look into that and make sure we react appropriately. that's what they get for not having a ROM! (having no luck determining what this detection routine is. Will have to boot skyfox and see what registers it hits, and where.)

[x] need to hook ctrl-reset to Mockingboard reset.

Add some debug diagnostics to see if we can figure out how/where Bank Street Music Writer is trying to detect the MB.

## Apr 26, 2025

mb / 6522 interrupts! I implemented an IRQ handler in the cpu. Now, to implement the counter mechanism in the 6522. This is the interrupt 

This is what the demo disk "interrupt-driven music" does.

mb_write_Cx00: 0b 40 ; auxiliary control register - 0x40 bit 6 means "continuous interrupts". (0 in bit 6 means one-shot interrupt)
mb_write_Cx00: 0e c0 ; interrupt enable register - bit 7 = set flag; bit 6 = set 'timer 1 interrupt enabled'
mb_write_Cx00: 04 ff ; W - T1 low-order latch ; R - T1 low-order counter
mb_write_Cx00: 05 69 ; R/W  - T1 high-order counter

That's 0x69FF - 27135. About 37 times per second. or, 2,220 per minute.

Whenever the low-order is written, it first goes into a latch. Then it's transferred into the counter whenever the high-order is written, so that the lo and hi are always put into the counter at exactly the same time.
The high order also goes into a latch.
Whenever the counter ticks down past 0, it reloads the counter from the latches automatically.
When latch is transferred into counter, the interrupt flag is cleared, and the timer begins countdown.

The cool thing here is this thing runs like clockwork; no matter how long our code might take, this counter will fire again exactly on interval. Saves a huge amount of effort trying to count cycles.

Page 2-42 of the 6522 data sheet goes into detail on the difference between REG6/7 and REG4/5. basically whether T1 interrupt flag is also set/reset.

So why would they enable shift register? Hm. Disregard for now.

So - write to 4, just store lo-order in latch. Then write to 5, trigger the other stuff.

So let's create event timer. ok, that's in and working. It does seriously slow things down however! Instead of maintaining an ordered tree (an expensive data structure on the heap) - at any given time there won't be -that- many of these things. Keep them in a fixed-size array. Whenever we insert one, we do this: we find an empty slot in that array and write the new record to it; and keep track of the cycle count of the next event (if new_event < next_event then next_event = new_event>). Then we can just scan the array when an event occurs. OR we can just cache the next cycle time and keep the current object and structure.

Or, maybe, we just fetch the next event time when we enter the cpu loop (or the index of the next event). that won't work, because it might change inside the loop. Yes, update the cache value whenever we modify the queue.

interrupt routines are working in the cpu - however the song is powering through at warp speed. I suspect the IRQ is not getting cleared, which will cause the code to immediately loop straight back in to the IRQ handler. In the morning, make sure I put in code to DE-assert IRQ in appropriate cases. (I am certain I am not doing this at all right now).

## Apr 27, 2025

So we have this current concept of getting and storing device state information based on a device type. The problem is, we may want multiple instances of the same type of device. For instance, two Disk II cards, or, two Mockingboards.

So, we need different routines for storing non-slot device info (for which there can only be one instance), but also slot-device info (for which we may have multiple instances.) 

Sweet! the interrupt-driven music demo now works, however, it doesn't shut off at the end, so I am missing something that is supposed to shut them off.. last thing they hit was this:

mb_write_Cx00: 04 1 0b 00   // 
mb_write_Cx00: 04 1 0e 7f   // disables all interrupts

0b is ACR - that sets bits 7, 6, 5 to "one shot interrupt".

Also still need to fix up reading the current counter values.

only reschedule an interrupt when Timer 1 interrupt enable is set.

[x] Refactor all the slot cards to use the Slot State concept instead of Device State.

Once a T1 counter hits 0, it either stops, or, restarts depending on setting in ACR.

What is the default (reset state) value of these registers?
Note that a load to a low order T1 counter is effectively a load to a low order T1 latch

If we're in once-decrement mode (ACR6 is 0) then if we are reading at a time beyond cpu->trigger then the counter read should be zero.
If ACR6 is 1, then we read a continuously cycling interval (i.e. the modulus).

Reset clears all internal registers except T1 and T2 counters and latches and the SR. T1 and T2 and the interrupt logic are disabled from operation. (This is while Reset is being held). 
let's say they're zero and ACR6 is 0 - then the counter will not count down or generate interrupts.
So if ACR6=0 and counter=0 return 0 on a read.
every time we trigger and interrupt and re-load latches, should we 
the WDC doc contradicts the Rockwell doc. Reg 7 write in WDC says IFR6 reset. Rockwell does not mention it. A 2004 WDC doc also says:
IFR6 is reset on write to 4, 5, 7, but not 6.
on a reset we need to propagate irq.
claude claims the counters are initialized to 0xFFFF on a power-on. That would make sense. but is it true?
chatgpt is saying they are undefined. but that's referring to output of pins while in reset state I think.
interrupt flags in IFR are set when they would be; interrupt disabled just means they won't propagate.
there's only one way to know for sure; check another emu ( ha ha ). apple2ts implements mockingboard too. on power up, it has latches at 0 and the counter is counting. That makes sense, that this is what bank street writer is checking for. it also lets you select sound fonts.
oh, funny, that's exactly what I'm doing right now. BSMW still claims no mockingboard. hmm.
T2 operates as a one-shot counter only, but otherwise similar to T1.

I broke the mockingboard demo where it plays a launch sound after the mockingboard. i.e. I broke the interrupts.

## Apr 28, 2025

Fixed the broken interrupts. it was in a couple places. Also, got music working in game play stage in ultima IV.

ok, this is the Skyfox MB detect code:

```
 | PC: $6856, A: $00, X: $04, Y: $04, P: $20, S: $A5 || 6856: LDY #$04
 | PC: $6858, A: $00, X: $04, Y: $04, P: $20, S: $A5 || 6858: JSR $686C [#685A] -> S[0x01 A4]$686C
 | PC: $686C, A: $00, X: $04, Y: $04, P: $20, S: $A3 || 686C: LDA ($70),Y  -> $C404.   mb_read_Cx00: 04
irq_to_slot: 4 0
  [#52] <- $C404
 | PC: $686E, A: $52, X: $04, Y: $04, P: $20, S: $A3 || 686E: CMP $70 -> #$00   M: 52  N: 00  S: 52  Z:0 C:1 N:0 V:0   ; 3 cycles
 | PC: $6870, A: $52, X: $04, Y: $04, P: $21, S: $A3 || 6870: SBC ($70),Y  -> $C404.   mb_read_Cx00: 04 ; 5+ cycles. Assume it's 5 since no wrap.
irq_to_slot: 4 0
  [#5A] <- $C404   M: 52  N: 5A  S: F8  Z:0 C:0 N:1 V:0
 | PC: $6872, A: $F8, X: $04, Y: $04, P: $A0, S: $A3 || 6872: CMP #$08   M: F8  N: 08  S: F0  Z:0 C:1 N:1 V:0
 | PC: $6874, A: $F8, X: $04, Y: $04, P: $A1, S: $A3 || 6874: RTS [#685A] <- S[0x01 A4]$685B
 | PC: $685B, A: $F8, X: $04, Y: $04, P: $A1, S: $A5 || 685B: BNE #$07 => $6864 (taken)
```

So it puts $C100 into $70 and $71, then indexes indirect by Y (which contains 4). So it reads each slot $CS04. Then it burns some cycles. Then it subtracts from C404 and if the difference is not 8, then it assumes we're not a mockingboard.

Issue is we're reading the same value twice. no we weren't. I wasn't printing the value! Derp.  ok, now I'm printing the value - determined I was counting up, not down (of course I was). now that I'm counting in reverse, skyfox detects the card; gets the first notes out; then hangs in an infinite interrupt loop. After it gets the first notes out, it is writing zeroes to all C400 to C4FF in reverse. What? Why? That's when we get the interrupt hang. Probably when we zero out the counter/latches for no good reason. hah.

Another note: initially, skyfox is only writing the low counter, 0xFF. that means interrupts every 255 cycles. Is it assuming the high register is something other than 0? Is it thinking there are many chips on here? I don't understand. of course we ignore this? yes.

what does mockingboard2.dsk do btw?loads a bunch of stuff.. then writes to $C443, $C440, $C443?? Whaa? then never gets an interrupt. That must be related to the speech chip. yes:
https://git.applefritter.com/Apple-2-Tools/4cade/commit/3f0a2d86799d72f5109951854825264b4daf40a5

```
         lda   #$80                  ; ctl=1
@mb_smc2
         sta   $c443
         lda   #$c0
         sta   $c443                 ; C = SSI reg 3, S/S I or A = 6522#1 ddr a
         lda   #$c0                  ; duration=11 phoneme=000000 (pause)
```
yah. So I guess that would be the final bit to do.

## Apr 29, 2025

Something is different between platforms - on linux, the Mockingboard1 demo disk blows chunks when it gets to the interrupt handling bits. Non-interrupt driven seems to work just fine.

btw here is some subtle 6522 voodoo:

http://forum.6502.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=2901

apparently after a 0, it takes a cycle for the latch to get reloaded. So that's why they load with value-1 in some places.

the interrupt is never clearing when we're in debug build. Also, coredump on linux. what the what

Whoa what's this? scheduleEvent: 13744632839234567870
Then we never get another schedule event and the interrupts never go away. Weird. ok.
That value is 0xBEBEBEBE (64 bits). I needed to initialize some registers, derpy derp.

So still not working on linux. what else is uninitialized. Ultima turns interrupts on before doing writing the counters. So, t1_triggered_cycles is zero. the IRQ never clears..

ok, I have added checks so we never use a 0 value for t1_triggered_cycles, nor do we ever use a zero value for t1_counter or latch. In the event of a 0, assume 65536 cycles. Made sure this change was done throughout the code, and that resolved the issues with Ultima IV. Let's try Skyfox again.. big fat nope! This stuff sure is twitchy.

Run another set of test across these games..

Rescue Raiders hangs after displaying Terrorists have been found at Cherbourg. I am wondering if that's a copy protection thing, because this is a .nib disk image. I can disable the mockingboard and try it again.. nope, with MB disabled it gets past that screen.

oh, there's the noise register, I'm not even sure what that is. I'm not checking it anywhere. That is an omission.

## May 1, 2025

big RGB discussion in DisplayNG.

## May 2, 2025

I just patched up my "RGB" mode instead of writing a whole new RGB mode. One thing to note: if we have blue, then black, then blue again, I cut off the first blue too quickly. I do everything that way.. it makes for crisp single-pixel lines. It's not necessarily bad.. though noticable in Taxman where the top left corner of boxes the lines don't quite meet the same way. It's definitely the trailing pixel.. I'm gonna call it good for now.

Things for a "real" II+ release. Whoa, is that happening?

This release goals (0.3):
* [done] refactor all the other slot cards (like mb) to use the slot_store instead of device_store.
* [ ] implement reset routine registry
* [ ] implement accelerated floppy mode
* vector the RGB stuff as discussed in DisplayNG correctly.
* make OSD fully match DisplayNG.
* refactor the hinky code we have in bus for handling mockingboard, I/O space memory switching, etc.
* Fix the joystick.
* implement floating-bus read based on calculated video scan position.

Release 0.35:
* Bring in a decent readable font for the OSD elements

Next release goals (0.4):

* GS2 starts in powered-off mode.
* can power on and power off.
* can edit slots / hw config when powered off.
* "powered off" means everything is shut down and deallocated, only running event loop and OSD.
* when we go to power off (from inside OSD), check to see if disks need writing, and throw up appropriate dialogs.
* put "modified" indicator of some kind on the disk icons.
* Implement general filter on speaker.cpp.

Then, we'll be in a position to start working on the IIe, which will be (0.5)!

We can legit only have one Videx in a system. Doesn't make sense to have multiple. Change its config setup to be slot-based, but,
[ ] somewhere we need to have a flag that we can only have one in a system.

I have the Videx building. HOWEVER: I hard-coded references to Slot 3 all over the place. So that needs to be fixed tomorrow.

## May 3, 2025

First bit of code is the annunciator hooks. These should go in their own module (i.e. global) that videx can read.

So I think the Videx is now slot-independent (i.e., *I* don't hard code slot 3 anywhere) except the Videx firmware itself assumes slot 3, I think.

I wonder if I should also check into the ntsc lookup table code and instrument to see how fast it is. yeah, it's taking a half second to initialize. That doesn't seem right?

Mike's hgrd lookup table calculator does this:
for each of 4 phases; it iterates through all 1 << 17 (131072) possible bit patterns that are 17 bits long.
then it runs processAppleIIScanline_init on each one of those to get an output pixel, and store it for the LUT.
For each of those iterations, it's creating two vector objects, doing a bunch of sin/cos, etc. Maybe this is a good thing to test profiling on. ok, yeah.

## May 4, 2025

Integrated in the new optimized video LUT generation routines, and am testing with 

Interestingly, there is a minor "fade-in" effect at the left and right edges, where even with a white field, there are artifacts as we come onto white. Not sure if that's supposed to happen - not sure if it happened before. I don't think it did. Checked it out - in fact, they were there before. it might be a hair more pronounced on 7/45 than 8/50. But the images are -extremely- similar.

[ ]: don't forget that the mockingboard still gets out of time sync slowly.

735 is sometimes not enough samples and causes crackling.
736 consistently is too many - it's 3,600 extra samples per minute.
perhaps I can read the number of samples in queue, and insert a number of samples appropriate to keep the queue length within a range of say 3,000 to 4,000.
if it's more than 4,000, do 734.
if it's less than 3,000, do 736.
in that range, do 735.

Well, ok, that is keeping it in range. it remains to be seen if that causes weird artifacts. Well, let's test that1

## May 5, 2025

I think I may have stabilized MB in ultima - sometimes it was getting in a loop where interrupts were never turning off. I fixed a bug - write to T1C-H is supposed to clear interrupt. I had that wrong - I had it on read T1c-H.

looking at skyfox again - it is crashing with PC=0000, which is a brk. and it's infinitely looping there because interrupts are enabled. So need to enable the full opcode trace to see what's happening.

I am not 100% certain, but I think my having all the interrupt-generating stuff and other MB stuff hard-coded to 1.0205mhz means mockingboard music that's interrupt-driven plays at a normal 1mhz rate. i.e. it's as if the mockingboard is running with a 1mhz clock even if the cpu is clocked faster. Stuff that is managed by the CPU tho gets buffered. So perhaps we should change the 10205 everywhere except the interrupt timer. Or, maybe that would mean scaling the interrupt timer based on the clock speed.. ok this isn't strictly true. if you run fast for a while the MB music is nowhere to be found..

Disk II reset caused a segfault on linux? Oh, I may still have a problem there.. not that, it's the parallel card trying to fclose a null pointer. fixed.

## May 6, 2025

on a lark I added "auto ludicrous speed when any disk II is on". it does indeed accelerate disk II accesses. they're instant. it screws up mockingboard output, which doesn't work after any period of ludicrous speed. But everything else is ace , ha ha. The audio generation window must get ahead of realtime, and can't come back. cycles gets ahead of the real time timer.

[ ] needs to disable ludicrous speed --when disk is scheduled for turnoff, not when it's actually turned off--  

Also, you can't ctrl-reset to stop things from booting because they --boot too fast--.

XPS Diagnostic IIe disk has a disk drive speed tester thing on it. It says I'm at 266 rpm, instead of 300. Be nice to investigate that code and see what it's doing.

made a lot of improvements to the joystick/game controller code. Still to do:

[x] support a 2nd joystick connecting  
[x] see about scaling when we're doing diagnoals. Karateka I can't make the guy run by pushing to upper-right, even though I'm supposed to be able to.  

## May 7, 2025

the Atari Joyport / Sirius Joyport is a device that maps an atari joystick (essentially a number of buttons) to the 3 button inputs on an apple ii. combined with the annunciators you can read two axes on two joysticks and 3 buttons.

## May 8, 2025

I have a thing here to refactor so the video subsystem initialization and state is kept in a separate area. Right now it's part of the "mb display". However, since we now have two and ultimately even more display subsystems, all the SDL variables (renderer, window, etc.) ought to live outside the display code, in their own CPU struct.

ok the first pass at video refactor is done. However, I think I need to bring the texture back into the apple ii display mode - each display renderer subsystem should have its own texture. ok that's done.

And, the video_system_t should be a class, with constructor, destructor, and more importantly, methods to render a full frame, managing scaling and the bodrer area appropriately. Did it! Also brought in the toggle_fullscreen concept.

That's a fair bit cleaner.

## May 9, 2025

Star Wars II is cool, but the paddle axes are exactly backwards from what makes sense on a joystick. Ugh. So we need a "reverse paddle/joystick axes" button.

## May 10, 2025

did some thinking about trace architecture. See the Tracing file.

Doing some work on the speaker. It's still buzzy. I don't like that. OE's speaker beep is very clear, and has relatively high frequency pitch.
I put a filter on the output, and it doesn't affect the buzziness, but it does dampen the high frequencies making it sound muffled.

test-first - starting point

test-2nd: set decay rate to 0x20 (was 0x200)

test-3rd: set filter alpha from 0.6 to 0.3
this produces a much smoother incline - HOWEVER.
the start of a transition is very sharp. The end of a transition is very smooth. in OE, the output is nearly linear.
changing alpha to 0.1 makes the waveforms very nearly a sawtooth or triangle wave. The frequencies cut off around 9khz. BUT there were still frequency spikes at higher frequencies! Hmmm.


oh that's interesting. OE is using 48K samples, we're using 44.1K samples. 

*** So, we can have a fractional cycle contribution per sample.

oh holy shit. I set the sample rate to 102000, samples per frame 1700. This creates an even divisor and the output is PERFECT.

SO. The issue all along has been, we are introducing noise probably for several reasons. But the big one was, we were not accounting for fractional cycles in sample calculation. I suppose after the loop is over I could do a one-time check for 

lots of testing. That was DEFINITELY the issue.

Timelord has a high pitched whine on GS2, OE, and a fuzzy whine on Virtual II. Ugh. Guess what? On the real thing, it doesn't.

So, have to figure out a good filter system. And, figure out how to handle the fractional cycle contribution. BUT IT WORKS.

I believe SDL3 is properly doing resampling as needed in software, even with weird non-standard sample rate etc. No need to complexify my algorithm. However, we might benefit from a low-pass filter of the input square samples before we cram it into SDL. And, might experiment a bit with the parameters. (Yes, I did a low-pass on the individual cycle samples as we accumulate in the contribution, and a second low pass after downsampling.)

I wonder what would happen if I passed in 1020500 samples per second to SDL and forewent all my contribution stuff.. there's only one way to find out!

On Mini, audio_time is now 40-50uS. On PC, it's 130uS. So this is quite a bit slower than before.

So, the audio routines are currently taking between 40 and 50 microseconds. This is pretty good, but I will miss when they didn't sound right but only took 6 microseconds. Ten times faster but garbage, ha ha. So, there are these following potential optimizations:

* switch to fixed-point math?
* maybe we can SIMD the filters by filtering the whole input and output frame all at once, instead of inline in the code.

## May 12, 2025

"For read operations, it's usually OK to read from a wrong address first, then reread from the correct address afterwards. You definitely don't want to write to a wrong address though, so on STA nnnn,X, the write is always on the 5th cycle (when the address is fully calculated), and the 4th cycle (where the address is sometimes wrong) is just a read that gets thrown away."

this is 6502 voodoo! if it's a RAM read nobody cares, but, if it's a I/O read it could impact a state machine. For instance,

implemented SDL_DelayPrecise instead of busy-waiting, which apparently is working quite well. It "sneaks" up on the desired time delay. That is basically the algorithm I was contemplating recently. Works great! Only 4% cpu use!

system tracing! Step 1 is refactor the 'debug' logging stuff to populate the trace record instead.

## May 17, 2025

debugger dna has been laid. I've implemented Tracing (per Tracing.md). A couple different interfaces. First, trace logs into a circular trace buffer, which stores for each instruction, the value of all registers at the start of the instruction, then the instruction opcodes, then the instruction disassembly, followed by the effective address and memory value read or written. the effective address varies based on the instruction; for memory movement it's the actual memory location referenced, which is handy to explain indirect and indexed address modes (don't have to figure out the effective address manually.) As with everything else in the system, 

I also implemented "pause execution". this sets the halt flag in the cpu. however, the way the code is right now, the clock keeps ticking along. This has the interesting effect that the audio routines will keep working. (Well, particularly, the mockingboard will). however, that also means that there will be big cycle discontinuities after you pause, or especially when you're single-stepping.

Even after fixing so we don't keep incrementing cycles, the mockingboard stays synced when step tracing. ha ha ha. It's miraculous!

Let's not call it halt. let's call the flag: execution mode. Execution mode will have the following values: normal; step-into; step-over. Then tie in some keyboard and buttons 

if debugger is open
   * go into single step mode on a BRK. otherwise handle BRK normally. can use brk for manual debugging checkpoints. otherwise, it means a crash, and you'll be able to see the backtrace.
   * when we write the trace record to the buffer, we can check the PC, the EFF address, against the breakpoint list.
   * handle up and down arrows; pgup and pgdn; home and end; mouse wheel up and down. These will scroll through the instruction buffer. Provide some visual indicator of where we are on the side of the window.

For progress bar, we can have it down the right edge -
   * draw rectangle
   * draw portion above current location in blue
   * draw portion below current location in green

We can likely prune down the image formats SDL_image handles. We really don't need all those. Shrink the code!
SDL_ttf isn't building. Not sure why.. oh, got it done ultimately by simplifying some cruft in the cmakelists.

## May 21, 2025

sdl_ttf complained when I built into a target directory. I got past that. however, I keep running into other issues, so I have been hammering away at the CMakeLists.

then I couldn't build SDL_ttf due to harfbuzz.cc failing compile for extremely weird reasons.

SDL_ttf says it loaded a newer vendored version of harfbuzz yesterday. That almost certainly has to be the issue. Man that was a waste of two hours. I disabled HARFBUZZ to at least get my builds working again.

I have been in build-system hell for the past 3 days. But learned a LOT about cmake. Had some folks jump in and start contributing! Awesome.

Other than that, have just tweaked a few things.

[ ] Still need to get Windows running with the new build system.  


## May 25, 2025

Thinking about handling multiple CPUs. There is a decision point here: other emulators allow running multiple emulated systems at the same time - perhaps as threads. Threading presents issues with SDL (lots of stuff has to run in main thread). Also, that's not my interest - the user can always start multiple instances of the emulator, and that's easier to conceptualize.

My original thought was to have a potential multi-core '816, for multitasking. Of course no software except GNO/ME (after heavy revisions) is going to know what to do with that.

But let's think through what that implies. You have multiple CPU cores. The cores however share: memory, peripherals, display, etc. So, even a multi-core system would share a display screen, an OSD, a system configuration, etc.

So practically instead of "CPUs[x]" being the top-level concept, we need a "system" or "motherboard" as the top-level (a global) that contains:
   cpus[x]; slots[]; device state; etc.
Practically, to support multi-core, there are two options: time-slice the cores inside the main event loop; or, have each 'core' have its own system thread. Geez, imagine a 4-core '816 running on the native system cores. That would be CRAY CRAY. The multi-threading approach - each thread(core) would need shared memory for the virtual RAM; how would they access hardware? How do we serialize h/w access? normally, the emulated OS would mediate multiple process access to h/w. That's not possible here. And I don't think it's possible in the emulator layer to do it.

Let's say we wanted to emulate the Z80 softcard. That is a different type of CPU, but it's still two CPU "cores" in the same system. It would fit this model. (i.e. we'd execute it with time-slices like I am considering doing here with multiple '816 cores).

So what we can do:
* multiple emulated systems, each with their own hardware, display windows, time-sliced; (run each instance as a whole new process);
* multiple CPU "cores" but the entire thing is time-sliced inside a single process/thread (or, a 6502 and a Z80 in the same process, time-sliced);

so let's consider a computer struct.

videosystem; // the higher level video system stuff for this window.

struct computer_t {
  systemconfig; // the "system configuration"
  cpu_state *cpu; // cpu state for this "computer". in theory could have an array for cpu cores.
  mmu_t *mmu; // mmu, and, memory, I/O decoding, etc lies behind this
  module_store; slot_store; // 
  OSD; // OSD for this "computer" instance 

  void reset(); // calls reset on registered peripherals, devices, and the cpu.
}

computer_t computers[MAX_COMPUTERS];

Ah ha, let's think about this now - SDL has CategoryProcess. What if for each virtual system we launched off a whole new OS-level *process*, not a thread. We could just fork off a new process from scratch. 

If we do it this way, we end up with the following things:

computer_t computer;

only ONE of those.

Maybe things will become clearer if I start to refactor cpu_struct into an object. There are a couple low-hanging fruit I can do - init_cpus, and cpu_reset. Let's dip toe in water. OK, that's done. Didn't break anything.

ok, I pulled a few things into cpu_state, like reset, init, etc.

Now, let's pull videosystem out of CPU and into computer. This is likely to be somewhat involved. Yes, it needs access to a bunch of memory stuff. And of course, is interacted with via the bus/memory code. So, perhaps we need to first look at that..

Currently memory.cpp/bus.cpp are a conglomeration and mishmash of stuff relating to memory (ram and rom), I/O, and routines that CPU uses to simulate a memory read or write (incl. incr_cycles). This needs to be split up into an MMU concept:

```
MMU -> MMU_IIPLUS
         -> MMU_IIE
         -> MMU_IIC
         -> MMU_IIGS
    -> MMU_III
```
etc. MMU is basic routines for managing a memory map and performing ram/rom read/write. The sub-classes add memory map handling for I/O, bank-switching, etc. Maybe MMU_IIE and MMU_GS are subclasses of the IIPLUS class, which defines critical Apple II concepts like the slot-related C8XX memory, the C0XX softswitches, the CNXX slot memory, etc. I think the MMU should also have to handle more than 64K of memory.

```
ADDRESS SPACE
   PAGE
      0400 - 07FF : monitor and flag video update when modified ("shadow")
      0800 - 0BFF : can check and only do something if that video mode is active
      2000 - 3FFF : no need to calculate hires stuff all over the place if hires mode isn't active
      4000 - 5FFF : 

      C0XX        : table of handlers for these
      C1XX - C7XX : individual page handlers for these
      C800 - CFFF : check page handlers, plus, CFFF access to "reset"

      CC00 - CDFF : Videx 512 byte memory window, should set to RAM
```
if page type RAM, allow r/w. If page type ROM, allow read only. If page type I/O, call a handler.
Handlers should all set and get a pointer for their callback, to a data object that holds all the state they need.

In *addition* to the read and write pointer (language card has different read/write pointers for the same addresses), we need a shadow pointer.
Shadow pointer is "tell me about writes".

for an 8 bit apple the memory map is 256 pages. For a GS, it's 65536 pages. And very few of the GS pages need to point to anything except ROM or RAM. So I wonder about having two layers of memory map, because this is just a LOT OF ENTRIES. In a GS, Banks E0 and E1 are basically just an Apple II's RAM. So, it really does seem like we'd want a IIGS MMU that contained IIGS memory mappings with large pages (maybe even no pages, that). So that's what we'll do - we'll have a IIGS mmu that handles IIGS fast ram and rom; handles shadowing in banks 00/01 -> E0/E1. The IIGS MMU will break memory up into 64KB chunks, and that will be the "page" size. OR, for my GNO/ME ambitions, break it up into 4K page sizes. that's 4096 pages for 16M address space. That's reasonable. And then anything in E0/E1 (and maybe 00/01 if shadowing enabled) we then make a call down into the IIE MMU that we allocated internally, and THAT MMU is set up for 256 byte pages.

So what are the key elements here? RAM, ROM, IO. RAM - option for shadowing writes to other RAM. Plus, I/O needs to be able to direct reads and writes to routines.

For later GS/OS / gno virtual memory, the virtual memory page tables should be in main RAM, and are a layer -on top of- the physical memory map.

Was just thinking about GS handling of speed shifting where sometimes specific cycles operate at 1MHz and some at 2.8MHz. Instead of tracking execution time per frame using just cycles, perhaps we do it by counting nanoseconds. e.g. 1MHz ~ 1000ns, and 2.8MHz ~ 350ns. The MMU has some control over the CPU clocking. It knows which cycles should be 1MHz and which 2.8MHz (or faster).

I modified the TRACE() macro as follows: removed the conditional inside it. Put the conditional in the beginning and ending blocks only.
If you define TRACE(SETTER) (to turn it off at compile time), you get about 650MHz sitting at basic prompt.
if you re-enable trace at compile, BUT disable trace at runtime, you can get around 580-600MHz. This is because we removed a -lot- of conditionals from all over the CPU execute_next function. While we do write some values to memory (e.g. the operand, memory read/write value, effective address), it's apparently a lot faster to do that than to do conditionals everywhere. Makes sense. So if you want to go super hyper mega mega fast, open the debugger and disable tracing. Seems like maybe we could default to tracing off when we 'boot'.

I have been hammering away at an MMU class. Two classes. One is barebones MMU, fairly generic, knows nothing about Apple II address space. A subclass of that is MMU_IIPlus, which does know about the Apple II address space more specifically, and handles: C000-C0FF softswitches, C100-C7FF slot card memory map, and C800-CFFF slot card additional memory map, and CFFF "disable slot card memory in C800-CFFF". That's all it knows. It acts as a broker for all the other functionality: RAM and ROM reading/writing; calling registered functions to handle C000-C0FF. 

The MMU classes implement a number of new concepts.

* Memory Shadowing - register a function that is called on write in any given page. This is -in addition- to for instance writing the value into RAM. This will be used to handle writes to the video pages to trigger video updates. This concept will also be used in the IIGS later with its bank0/1 shadowing to E0/E1.
* read_p and write_p. with the Language Card, we can have reads and writes going to different chunks of memory. So for each page, reads and writes can be set separately. And, this will allow us to handle the Videx combo of RAM and ROM in its C800 space w/o special IF statements anywhere.
* read_h and write_h. These are -handlers-, i.e., function pointers; what we do today on a more limited scale with register_C0XX_read_handler etc., is now applicable also to pages. This will be used to handle the weird Mockingboard C400-C4FF which is all softswitches and not memory at all.
* We no longer rely on the value of type (ROM, RAM, IO) as this is not dispositive. It's used now just for diagnostic output.
* There are useful dump methods for diagnostics.

This is performance testing done with the "mmutest" app test harness.
```
Time taken: 1214654625 ns
total bytes read/written: 983040000
ns per byte read/written avg: 1.235611
maximum simulated clock rate w/memory access every cycle: 809.316467 MHz
```

If we did nothing but NOP, one cycle is a memory read, the other cycle is nothing. So the maximum possible speed of that is 1.6GHz. However, of course, we do a ton of other processing around every instruction. So, uh, no. But, this should be no slower than the current routines and probably faster as I made some decoding optimizations that reduce the number of conditionals. I could make the same optimizations in the current code, but, that is limited utility if I'm going to replace that code shortly anyway.

Now here's a fun thing - in theory, we could write special read_word routines that could then probably read twice as fast.

Analyzing the Steve2 code. It uses global variables for the Apple2_64K_RAM, and the aux ram. It's saying that this can save on pointer lookups. I guess that makes sense.
Another optimization is *potentially* the use of uint8_t (full bytes) instead of bit fields for the Processor status register. You'd have to create a P status value whenever you push or pop it from the stack. But that may save a bunch of load and bit test operations, and potentially a bunch of read-modify-write operations. We do hit these almost every instruction. 
There is also a lot of hardcoding of various I/O switches. This means there is no flexibility in what hardware is included, or what slots it's in.
One other trick they do is have a page that "throwaway" writes can go to
They return a random number on a floating bus read, as opposed to one calculated from video memory. 
on reset they set SP to 0xFF, and flags to 0x25. Hmmm. I need to check the data sheet on that.

Giving thought to memory mapping in the IIe environment. There is the added complexity of Auxiliary memory; treatment of page 00/01 with bank-switching there; etc. The current setup will require us to modify a number of pointers whenever we bank-switch. You can set reading and writing independently, which we can handle with read_p and write_p. But it seems like a lot of setting pointers whenever we switch. I guess honestly it's not that much - the disk ii and video code do far more mangling. I was thinking that instead of storing whole pointers, I could store page indexes.. e.g. text display bank bank 004, and aux bank 104. Then we just shift left 8 bits to get the offset into a 128K memory bank, then use the page offset. I.e., we map the page to a new page, then keep the offset part. my thought was, what if I could just add that 0 or 1 (for main or aux) based on the soft switch settings as part of the address calculation and thereby not have to change 256 pointers every time we switch. i.e. trade a little math every read/write, versus changing pointers whenever the switch is hit. if programs generally sit in one bank, then setting the pointers is a win. If programs flip back and forth a lot, then the bit of extra math is a win. I guess we can only test it and find out. Let's just proceed with the current setup and see how it goes.

Testing just the base MMU class, we get this performance:
```
Time taken: 514877875 ns
total bytes read/written: 983040000
ns per byte read/written avg: 0.523761
maximum simulated clock rate w/memory access every cycle: 1909.268311 MHz
```
that implies we lose more than 50% of performance by adding the 2nd layer.

Since I now have this separate MMU class, I should be able to construct a CPU test target that runs the 6502 test suite against this MMU, to allow testing of the CPU code independently of the rest of the emulator. (Full circle!)

Learned about Apple Instruments - profiling visualizer - and how to use it to profile code. Seems like it would be much easier to use this than the other profiling I was using. And, use this to performance test various modules. What I learned about GS2 so far: it spends most of its time busy-waiting for timing. ha!

## May 27, 2025

Apple IIe memory management:

* ALTZP: switches pages 00/01 between main and aux, independently of other settings.
* 80STORE
  * 80STORE ON AND HIRES OFF: PAGE2 switches 4-7, between main and aux, independently of other settings. 
  * 80STORE ON AND HIRES ON: PAGE2 switches 4-7 and 20-3F between main and aux, independently of other settings.
* RAMRD: ON means READ from Aux memory in 0200 - BFFF; OFF means READ from MAIN memory in 0200 - BFFF
* RAMWRT: ON means WRITE to Aux memory in 0200 - BFFF; OFF means WRITE to MAIN memory in 0200 - BFFF

Note: "When you switch in the auxiliary RAM in the bank-switched space, you also switch the first two pages, from O to 511 ($0000 through S01FF)." What does this mean?
"The other large section of auxiliary memory is the language-card space, which is switched
into the memory address space from 52K to 64K ($D000 through SFFFF). This memory
space and the switches that control it are described earlier in this chapter in the section
"Language-Card Memory Space." The language-card soft switches have the same effect on
the auxiliary RAM that they do on the main RAM: The language-card bank switching is
independent of the auxiliary RAM switching."
ok asked the group.

Short version: while there are cases where you can switch the entire 48K memory space, there are many situations where you don't. So we're going to be manipulating lots of "pointers" for each page no matter what. The only way to reduce the amount of work would be to change the page size. If we do that, then we have to have several layers in some cases to further decode accesses. Let's say we switched to 1K pages. We'd have to have special handling of 0-3ff (it's split half and half between stuff that can toggle in and out of AUX mem). And the I/O space would be chopped up awkwardly. 4K pages - 0-FFF is super awkward, but, the rest of the memory map less so. In short, a fair bit of complexity. I still think it's best to try using 256-byte pages, as we have it now.

ok I've got the 6502 CPU test program working again, in its own app.

Working on decoupling cpu & old mmu - see [MMU.md].

## May 28, 2025

next step is to disable all the devices, and start adding them back in one by one after modifying for the new MMU. This will typically involve them no longer being passed cpu_struct.

OK, I did the IIPlus keyboard. Relatively easy! I say "Relatively". ha. I suppose I can do the speaker next. It has a super-simple I/O interface.
Speaker is hooked back up. Muahaha.
Display doesn't work. That will be some effort, lots of modules accessing memory. That needs some refactoring too, to use direct memory accesses instead of the MMU interface.

With this MMU work, it might be feasible to go for an Apple III configuration right out of the gate as my next deal as opposed to a IIe. That could be fun.

ok, the display code is updated! That wasn't bad at all. 
Gamecontroller done.. 
Language card. It's a definite maybe. ProDOS boots! Need to run the language card tester.. which means, DiskII is next.
Disk II done. whoo!
lang card test seems to work. Fixed a bug in the keyboard (AI changed the C010 to C000 on writes, boo, hiss).
Fixed the prodos_clock.
So, booting with -p 0 doesn't work because something important is missing. It must be the Videx it won't run without. Well we know what's next then, don't we..

## May 29, 2025

I still have a few cards left to refactor, but this is actually going swimmingly. I was very worried about the LangCard because of it's complexities, but the register interface didn't change, and that was the hardest part. (Still need to fix the double read in certain instructions). 
mockingboard and parallel cards done. That might be it?? it might be. Do a day of testing, then clean up all the commented-out stuff, before doing a commit and push.

So, when there is not a mockingboard in the systemconfig, we crash. Yah. Let's see.. ok, let's take bus.cpp and memory.cpp out of the build.

Overall my Effective MHz is down about 15% to the 350 range. Ah of course that's with tracing going on in the background and stuff.

There is an obvious optimization to be had in the device code: instead of passing cpu as the callback context, and then calling get_slot_state etc etc., just store the device record directly. A lot of these devices don't care about the cpu, only the mmu. So store mmu in the device state, and use device state as the callback. Then we have a number less indirections to do. Another optimization could be: move the mmu->read and write stuff up directly into MMU_II. 
Hmm, Claude is suggesting my mmu->read *won't* be inlined because it's virtual. That's a concern I had. 

Claude request ID: a6e8c069-3392-4714-8bde-77d0e9417dc0

of course we're also: doing a function call, and, doubling up on 

We can put the memory read first - need to make sure we never have both read_p and read_h, or write_p and write_h. (should be exclusive). Might also consider struct of arrays instead of array of structs for the page table arrays.

Action items:
[ ] the MMU should be cognizant of the starting address of the system ROM rd. Perhaps pass in the rd struct instead of the raw address, because then we can get the starting address to do the page map correctly on setup.

manually putting the mmu:read stiuff into mmu_ii is good for about 30MHz improvement.
of course in the keyboard loop there are a ton of calls to the keyboard C000 read routine. look at the context trick above.

keyboard, had to create a state record. We were using a global before. We will of course have different keyboards in the future so need to be agnostic there.

testing with trace turned off (not compiled out: in, but disabled)
test 1: 520MHz
test 2: 550MHz - 

test with trace compiled out: 

[ ] There is a slight issue here which is that the cpu has a member for MMU_II. This should be MMU. And then all the things that need to use it need to cast it to MMU_II. Or, provide some sort of middleware that converts to a minimal interface for the CPU that only provides read and write (and context to use).

[ ] I had a thought about speed-shifting. Which is, changing speeds in the middle of a frame. Instead of only counting cycles, we will count virtual nanoseconds. We know how many nanoseconds per cycle there are. We can do it in the main loop. And then, instead of the main run loop waiting for about 17,000 cycles, it checks to see if exactly 16.6666667 milliseconds have elapsed, regardless of speed (60fps). We could also count the ns elapsed based on feedback from the MMU - this would be for the GS and other "accelerated" platforms where inside a single instruction the clock could be numerous different speeds.

OK, next step is to start going through devices and seeing if I can reduce the codependencies on the CPU some more. Some things go into Computer. Like VideoSystem. 

Some terminology:
* a "slot" is a device that you could have multiple of in a system.
* a "module" is a motherboard device that you will only have one of in a system.

First thing: implement a "event delivery registry". Keyboard, and game controller, need to receive events. Display should too - to handle F2, F3, F5, etc. Keyboard would check for key down events. Game controller for gamepad add and delete. Just like they do now, except, not hardcoded into a loop. But placed in a list. When an event is accepted and handled, return a true and stop processing other handlers. Will this be part of "computer"? Perhaps its own thing, but an instance lives in Computer.

Then we also need a "process frame" for cards / modules. Now, you think this is only for mockingboard and videx - and you would be wrong! The Disk II "frame handler" can update the disk drives status for the OSD. We can do for other devices too that need to present status. Then OSD isn't tightly coupled to Disk II. Annunciator can publish its status too for the display subsystems. So for this we have:
* mockingboard
* speaker
* display (update flash state; update display;)
* videx (update display)
* diskii / smartport - post drive status for osd
So we have these categories of "frames": cpu frame; audio frame(s); video frame(s); OSD frame; Debugger frame; event frame(s).

It makes sense to have each type of "frame" in its own queue, in its own loop. Easily done.

## May 30, 2025

[x] need to hook "init default memory map" to the reset routine.. ? Was in reset.cpp.

All the slot cards and modules now get passed computer_t to their init_ functions.

So this "register reest routine" stuff is a good idea. I removed a bunch of module dependencies. However, I have new dependencies in computer_t - video_system. The main body of code is fine with this, but the standalone speaker app uses speaker.cpp which uses computer which wants video_system etc. So, the speaker test app is more about testing the reproduction logic. Separate speaker into core speaker logic, and the speaker module. Then speaker app will use core speaker, not slot card. The "core" knows how to play back from the speaker event buffer. The slot module knows how to add events to the buffer. 

OK, have the start of the event queue. I think we need a "System queue" that has a chance to process events before, particularly, the emulated machine keyboard routine gets them. Things like the F keys. I'm finding I can rip lots out of the old event_poll this way. It will soon be history.

## May 31, 2025

Keyboard is now free of needed get/set module state, because it's context is now set whenever callbacks are made. It's possible none of the devices will need this at the end of the day, which would be swank.
Finish up the event poll refactor. Coming along. set up a "system" event queue, events that get handled as a priority before the regular event handlers.

OK, the event loop has been re-done, replaced with EventDispatcher. This use of the lambdas was a good idea, it definitely is helping to decouple stuff. The code modules that register event handlers are, right now: computer, videosystem, gamecontroller, keyboard, display.

Right now have two separate queues - system and normal. system basically just gets first grab at an event. Instead of this, I could queue with a priority.

i did -not- wire back in keypresses that generate screen captures, or enable audio recording. I could have debugger commands for these functions instead.

Now I'm wonder if the reset() queue should just be an instance of EventDispatcher to benefit from the lambda fun. Hmm. YES. NO. That is set up for SDL events. Put that on ice while we think about it.

I need to pass computer-> into OSD so OSD can call reset.
    osd = new OSD(computer, computer->cpu, vs->renderer, vs->window, slot_manager, 1120, 768);
So a lot of the other stuff I'm passing in, is available under computer. cpu, videosystem (and then to renderer and window).
slot_manager should probably be in computer then, too.
The get_module_state and set_module_state etc. can be less about finding our own state now, more about publishing state.

I want to add the little tab thingy to the edge of the OSD. First, I am now tracking a "control opacity" which is a thing that will fade controls out after mouse inactivity. practically, should also keep them displayed if the mouse is -not captured- and moves, or, not captured and is in the controls area. That part is easy enough.
Trouble now is: when I click the button, the right thing happens. But the mouse is captured. because we keep processing the event afterward. I need to do:
in tile:handle_mouse_event I need to return a bool from that whole thing back up the stack to tell higher-up we took the event.

I guess now let's get back to the debugger!!

## June 1, 2025

The hideaway tab for opening the OSD looks and works pretty good I think. It follows these UI design rules:

it should be obvious to user when users do normal user things, what the interaction options are.

[x] I should finish implementing the "disappearing message".  (done!!)

I should maybe also put the fade-away logic into its own widget type, like FadeButton or something.

Thinking about copy and paste, because, I have a hundred things to do on this project but this one would be fun. ha ha! Since there is no keyboard buffer on a II+/e, the GS has one but it's quite small.

So - when a paste is done, the text must be put into a buffer, and, we need to meter it into the keyboard routine.

Each frame:
    if there is pending paste text remaining,
        check to see if the keyboard latch is clear.
        if yes, inject a Key Down event ourselves.

So that could (likely) work at up to 60cps. And if software is a little slow for some reason to read the keyboard and clear the latch, we sit and wait. There should be some way to stop a paste operation. A reset() should do it. Drag and drop of text would work the same way. Two different events, same implementation. Using the "create stream of keyboard events" makes it device-agnostic.
I don't think there is any feasible way to support any media type other than text. where should this live? split. define that keyboard modules must support the paste semantics. they're the ones that check themselves for readiness, and, register a frame callback to do so.

Now, for copy. Copy - we create a clipboard object that takes a snapshot of the screen at a particular moment. And we can offer multiple media types. text page could for instance offer text and a graphics image of the frame buffer.
We then tell SDL3 we're "offering" a particular media to the clipboard. We don't actually -provide- it until requested via a callback.

Shift-insert is fine for paste as a keyboard shortcut. copy? maybe print screen? What are the SDL mechanics of grabbing the frame data? Will have to investigate.

claude suggests the following:
https://claude.ai/chat/d62f96a2-8d7b-473c-8847-e8578269d0bb

i.e. keep all my screen data in CPU primarily and just chuck it to the gpu once in a while. That is actually working really well. When there are full-screen updates going on, it's actually running faster to do just one update per frame of the entire texture than up to 24 partial texture updates. Running in about 1/2 the time it used to.

Still getting a 3x benefit of partial display recalculation vs doing the whole thing (500us for full update, 175-200us for partial). Of course, the hires calculations even with LUT are fairly expensive, so not having to do all of those is a savings. But - are there any possible optimizations if we get rid of that?
* fewer conditionals
* don't have to do the txt/hires shadowing. That could save a lot of horsepower on the CPU side not having to do all those calculations on the update side, and I don't have a way to measure that easily.
* what about generating the scanline bits in actual bits, instead of in bytes. I would be moving 8x less data around. This doesn't help once we get to the IIgs of course but would for the legacy II modes.

But I -still- have the entire display in VRAM texture that I can use to create thumbnails. And in RAM I can stuff into the clipboard.

(Just tested on linux - this made an even bigger performance improvement there, I have frame draws getting down to 100us! I wonder how windows will react..)
ok, I got build working on Win with PROGRAM_FILES=ON. The other causes it to try to insert /share/blah. still need to switch windows to use cpkg.

## June 2, 2025

got event_queue pulled out of cpu and into computer. Getting there! A good next bit will be 'mounts'. 
Done. Also doing a bunch of misc. cleanup. Some functions have multiple iterations of commented-out code. ick.
Got video_system out of cpu too.

[ ] For efficiency, we should draw the control panel template - the styling, "Control Panel" text, etc whatever nice graphics we want, into a texture and then just lay down that texture first with the dynamic elements on top of it. Right now not a big deal, but, if we want something really nice-looking it will need to be done this way.

Event_Timer needs to go into computer too. This should involve only the mockingboard right now.. yep, and done. 
Two main things left in CPU that should go, are the clocking stuff (not the clock counter, but the stuff that determines clock speed) and module_store / slot_store.
I bet I can remove a lot of headers from cpu.hpp..

The Videx code should be modified to only LockTexture once per frame, just like the updated display code. done

The modal dialog should be updated with fonts that are actually readable. Done, though I just noticed that if you hover the Cancel button it changes the whole frame coloring. Something's not setting the colors it wants.

* UI principle: either save and restore all context you touch, or, just set all the context you need every time.

videx: Videx color used should track video engine mode: color and RGB should be white; mono should use selected mono color.
Currently these routines live in display. They should live in computer.

And we should have a single flag somewhere in videosystem to force a full frame redraw. Key frame draw as it were.

that's sort of in place. But, let's think about the engines. We have engine, which is basically the type of virtual "monitor" connected.
NTSC; RGB; Monochrome.
But we also have different video sources: Videx; Apple II Display; GS display; etc.
for now I need to push the current display engine and mono settings down into videosystem so videx can get it. And, practically, these settings ought to be in the videosystem itself.

Remove bounds checking from all scanline emitters, they're not necessary.

ok, the breakdown is this:
stuff that is general to the emulaTOR - like how we present an application window to the OS; how we draw pixels, and scale; and whether the user wants ntsc, rgb, or monochrome, are decided by the app. It sets values into videosystem; the various display modules can get those values to make rendering decisions. They do not need to handle 
BUT, things like the NTSC configuration is done specifically for the NTSC rendering system in the emulaTED, which is specific to the apple II display module. Videx has no need of it, nor will the Apple IIgs SHR stuff, which will be much simpler direct pixel mapping from GS SHR buffer to modern video buffer.

I've discovered a problem in system timing! a basic benchmark that runs in 1:53 on OE and according to the Creative Computing benchmark from 1983/4, runs in 1:43 on GSSquared. Oops. That's about a 9% difference.
I think the cycle timing is accurate in the main loop, i.e. that I'm getting 1020500 cycles per second. So what could be wrong is that some instructions tick the wrong number of cycles.
basic is gonna be doing a ton of (indirectzp),x etc. 
ROR ZP,X : should be 6 cycles, we're only ticking 4!
oops.
I wonder if this was something broken recently with the mmu updates.. hmm..
in the debugger I see tons of:
ROR $02,X
they are only ticking 4 cycles. 6502opcodes says they should be 6! hey, this is the new super-efficient 6502D.
* ROR A - 2 cycles. load the opcode; rotate.
* ROR ZP - load the opcode; load operand; load memory; rotate; write memory
* ROR ZP,X - load the opcode; load operand; add X; load memory; rotate; write memory (6 cycles)
* ROR ABS - load the opcode; load operand, load operand_hi; load memory; rotate; write memory (6)
* ROR ABS,X - load the opcode; load operand, load operand_hi; add X; load memory; rotate; write memory (6)

This is likely what's making the disk speed wrong.
ok, I added a cycle tick in rotate. I'm still one short. I need an extra one for zp,x.
Made the same fixes for ASL,LSR,ROL.
ZP,Y is counting right?

This is a lot to stare at. And lots of potential interactions. I need to write a test program that tests each instruction and the cycles generated by each. That should be pretty straightforward. Have each instruction in turn in a big assembly file. Have an index of them in the C program. do a single execute_next with the PC set to that. Have to test each case and condition.

Hey, I'm at 1:53 now. So for purposes of all this FP math the ROR was the big deal. for fun let's check locksmith disk speed.. nope, still reads very very slow. 

I have the program ccbench1 on testpo.po

## Jun 5, 2025

ok to work around the problem with mac in the GoodFullscreenMode blowing up when it opens up the file dialog, we've got two options.
* build our own file dialog. (I really don't wanna)
* or, leave fullscreen mode then open the dialog.

I've tried doing this code:

```
#if __APPLE__
    if (osd->computer->video_system->get_window_fullscreen() == DISPLAY_FULLSCREEN_MODE) {
        osd->computer->video_system->set_window_fullscreen(DISPLAY_WINDOWED_MODE);
        osd->computer->video_system->sync_window();
    }
#endif
```

right before we call the dialog thing, however, it doesn't help. I think we don't have time to run through some events and actually perform all the fullscreen mode change stuff.

This would suggest the following process:
instead of immediately calling the OS file selector, we send an event to the main loop to do it.
that event handler does: screen change, then send ourselves an event for next time round, to open the dialog;
this is a hassle! But maybe it's better to do the dialog from the event loop than deeper in the code anyway?

You know, opening the Mac dialog is slow ugly and awkward anyway.. and then we'd have the same interface per platform that would be consistent across platforms.. not now. Put this down for a Later Project.

for now let's ask the user to leave full screen before opening disk. tee hee.

Also, I implemented a diskII accelerator. Got the idea from apple2ts. instead of trying to load the entire byte at once to speed up (as I'd tried), they only skip 6 bits or something. So I tried that and it's working pretty well. Let's alpha test this a while before releasing to the wild. (I still like the "ludicrous speed when disk is on" but I suspect it's going to have other issues even if I get around the current one..)

for Container - allow specifying different Layout object dependencies. E.g., grid layout - but also linear, etc.

also, for buttons/tiles etc - refactor to use lambdas instead of the C-ish setup I have now. Lambdas are superiore! Do it now before it gets to be way more stuff to refactor later. I am able to do it both ways (separate version of the function for lambdas. so we can refactor a bit at a time).

```
boot prodos 2.4.3 in vscode debugger;
hit tab a couple times;
hit a bad memory reference 

    media_descriptor *media = pdblock_d->prodosblockdevices[slot][drive].media;
        fseek(fp, media->data_offset + (block * media->block_size), SEEK_SET);

media-> is a bad pointer here.
(Fixed).
```

in the trace Pane, we need to eventually make room for 24 bit addresses and 16-bit registers. So we'll need maybe 10 extra characters per line.
[ ] in trace, option to hide raw bytes and only show PCPC: LDA $xxxx  This will save 10 chars.   
[x] Can also bring the EFF left another few characters to save room.  
[x] Shorten Cycle some more

[ ] Develop a "line output" class that hides some of the complexity of generating this text line output. e.g. line->putc() stores char and automatically increments.  
[ ] Develop a "scrollable text widget" that will allow display of lines from a generalized text buffer.

ok, I think we want to move (or replicate) the following controls from the osd control panel, to hover controls (like the pull-out tab):
* display engine
* cpu speed
* reset button

## Jun 6, 2025

I am pretty sure the Skyfox problem is just that it's a bad crack. It's overwriting the interrupt vector (or never setting it in the first place). Looking at 3F0.3FF you can see it get overwritten backwards along with other stuff in the text page 1. So when the interrupts kick on it's just garbaged there.

But the big news is: I determined this with the DEBUGGER, BABY!

I made huge progress on this debugger over the past couple days. Adding to the trace screen from before, I now I have a (very) basic monitor and a memory monitor. I need to add monitor commands to control the memory watch.

Have a TextEditor widget that lets you edit a line of text. insert, delete, backspace and arrows work. don't have copy/cut/paste.

[x] next bit: do a forward-looking disassembler.  

## Jun 7, 2025

I added monitor commands for controlling breakpoints and memory watch.

I'm wrong! Skyfox claims to be Apple II compatible, and, it boots fine in II+ mode in Virtual II. My theory is now that Skyfox is failing because something in there is accessing language card control through a (ZP,X) lookup, which may be relying on 6502 ghost reads aka phantom reads. 
let's go back to that system tester program : audit.dsk
bp's: d17b; c080-c08f;

639e - inc $C083,X - ok, what does this do.
reads c083;
reads c083 again?
writes c083

Test Suite for Mockingboards and 6502/65c02:
[ ] https://github.com/tomcw/mb-audit  

ok, three reads in a row does not seem to cause any problems. how about writes..

Ah, well I found a difference in my language card impl: STA C083 on mine does nothing; in Sather and in a2ts it enables read from RAM!
DOH! That was it. Skyfox is working!! I wonder what else will work now.. HA TOTAL REPLAY boots now. It also detects 64K and the mockingboard automagically. and skyfox on that runs.
checking rescue raiders.. how do I start the game.. 

HERE is the holy grail bible of exactly what the NMOS 6502 does on each cycle.
https://xotmatrix.github.io/6502/6502-single-cycle-execution.html

## Jun 8, 2025

ok! So I got the inc abs,x stuff refactored. here it is. A few innovations here. First, I defined a union struct to make dealing with address calculations like this way easier - instead of doing tons of manual masking and bit-shifting I can just refer to lo and hi portions of an address or the whole thing. This makes coding the pieces that are modifying these bits much easier, and probably more efficient TBH.

Second is just formatting the code in a nice way to show the cycle breakdowns more clearly inside the function.

```
struct addr_t {
    union {
        struct {
            uint8_t al;
            uint8_t ah;
        };
        uint16_t a;
    };
};
        case OP_INC_ABS_X: /* INC Absolute, X */
            {
                inc_operand_absolute_x(cpu);

inline absaddr_t get_operand_address_absolute_x_rmw(cpu_state *cpu) {
    addr_t ba;
    ba.al = cpu->read_byte_from_pc();      // T1

    ba.ah = cpu->read_byte_from_pc();      // T2

    addr_t ad;
    ad.al = (ba.al + cpu->x_lo);
    ad.ah = (ba.ah);
    cpu->read_byte( ad.a );                // T3 

    absaddr_t taddr = ba.a + cpu->x_lo;    // first part of T4, caller has to do the data fetch

    TRACE(cpu->trace_entry.operand = ba.a; cpu->trace_entry.eaddr = taddr; )
    return taddr;
}

inline void inc_operand(cpu_state *cpu, absaddr_t addr) {
    byte_t N = cpu->read_byte(addr); // in abs,x this is completion of T4
    
    // T5 write original value
    cpu->write_byte(addr,N); 
    N++;
    
    // T6 write new value
    set_n_z_flags(cpu, N);
    cpu->write_byte(addr, N);

    TRACE(cpu->trace_entry.data = N;)
}
```

A next step is, I think, to try redefining these as macros instead of as inline functions. That will result in much faster code when compiling non-optimized. It may also eliminate the question of whether the compiler inlined a function or not. More importantly, I think it will avoid all the errors I get when editing the cpu.cpp code.

Another revelation is that the 65c02 implementation will be very different because of this - some of its instructions are different cycle counts, and it does fewer of these false reads. And then the 65816 puts many of them back in! holy toledo.

And also I had been doing a lot of thinking about the '816, its 16 bit registers, the D and B handling, etc. are all going to make it very difficult to just reuse this code.

And this implies a different code re-use strategy. In fact it may not be possible to reuse large chunks of the switch statement because of this as I'd originally envisioned. And, the "undocumented opcodes" probably shouldn't be ignored.

[x] I have a lot of functions where the instruction switch just calls the function. I should flatten that out. That will also help unoptimized execution time.  
[ ] Explore: can I have an optimized memory read function for zero page, stack since they can't possibly do any I/O stuff? They -can- be remapped but can't do I/O. Not sure it will make a big difference.


[x] implement cache of things like 'is trace on' by checking once per frame, not every instruction execution.  

## Jun 9, 2025

some loop optimizations? See what kind of difference some of these things make:
15.7610, 15.8359
move cycle subtraction outside of loop: 15.9243, 15.9073, 15.8835 - seems to have helped a bit.
cache processEvents: 16.3768, 16.4482: good. make sure it works. ha!
16.4 / 15.8 = almost 4%.

When we're in free run in the main loop, we are only processing 17008 cpu cycles. but in free run, this will do the frame-based stuff checks a hundred times more often maybe? Wasted time. however I set the cycles per 'frame' for free run mode to 66665 (4 times as much) and effective mhz slowed down? I am getting tons of audio queue underruns. I am not generating enough audio data. 170080. a bit slower yet. frame processing stuff must be failing somehow. compiled with optimizations, I get 356MHz. That might be a hair better. Let's put it back for now.

## Jun 10, 2025

ok, disassembly in debugger is there! it could certainly stand to be fancier. Particularly, . There is also prospective 10-line disassembly following the program counter when in stepwise trace mode.
What we don't have: retrospective diassembly pane. this would be: current instruction centered vertically; disassembly going backwards, and forwards, from that point.

Backwards disassembly on the 6502 is tricky. Here is the basic idea though. This is going to be some kind of a tree search algorithm to maximize the successfully decoded instructions.

1. check PC-1 to see if it matches any 1-byte instructions. If so, mark it as tentative.
2. then check PC-2 to see if it matches any 2-byte instructions. if so, we may need to rethink step 1.
3. then check PC-3 to see if it matches any 3-byte instructions. If so, .. you get the idea.

the trouble with this is, for any given chunk of bytes, there could be many interpretations.

[ ] create a scrollbar widget. the up, down, home, end, pg up and pg down events will go to it. it handles paging, and lets the caller query the current position.  
[ ] scrollbar should be clickable, and this jumps the position to that location  

[ ] Have device frame registration function and call from main event loop  

I decided that devices can have private state - but also "published" state, that other modules in the system can query. I am currently kind of using SlotData and MODULE data for both purposes. But, we want these separate.

The "published" data will be pushed by a device during the device's "frame handler". as far as other parts of the system are concerned, it's readonly. And it rests on a base class that stands alone, that doesn't require something like the OSD or debugger to pull in all the detailed headers and data structures from Disk II, etc.

So aside from - generating audio data - emitting video frame - devices can push this status stuff out. The "published info" will be to "well known names". The first time, an entry is created. Succeeding times, the entry is replaced. go with an integer as the name, sort of like I did the Disk "keys". And the stuff may not be super-high-performance (ie. using vectors and such) so you want to only access any of it during frame time. (i.e., NOT during the CPU loop).

How about we call them "mailboxes"? Let's ask claude. ha. Claude agrees. It's so easy to manipulate claude. Poor Claude. NOPE. MessageBus and Message, to be completely boring.

ok, have an implementation. Now to try it.

## Jun 11, 2025

implemented DeviceFrameHandler concept, and mockingboard now uses it. Works! Now I should be able to have TWO mockingboards in a system_config. 

The reset handler stuff needs to be switched around to use lambdas and pass more specific context. with two mockingboards the 2nd one doesn't reset correctly because it's hardcoded for slot 4 lol. oops.
Do a text search on SLOT_4 to make sure we get 'em all. (done)

Well this is interesting, Ultima V supports a MIDI interface for music. Huh. Apple2ts supports it. how? 
"Passport card" and software. Web MIDI supports virtual devices in browser. 

This looks like the ticket right here for what will be a cross-platform library to take MIDI in and synthesize output:

https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/wiki/MadeWithFluidSynth

This will be for the //e implementation because Ultima V requires 128K iie to do music. And as far 

Mockingboard mixing really takes a beating in Cybernoid music demo.

need to refactor these to use MessageBus:

bool any_diskii_motor_on(cpu_state *cpu) {
int diskii_tracknumber_on(cpu_state *cpu) {
drive_status_t diskii_status(cpu_state *cpu, uint64_t key) {

But MessageBus -will- need a concept of "find me all messages that match a class type". E.g., "any diskii motor on" needs to iterate all disk II's. I'm not gonna use this but the IIgs does this (slows clock while any diskII motor is on..)
But also OSD wants to iterate all the possible disk controllers in the system to construct its displays, instead of hardcoding them.
OR. the diskII routines have a global variable, which is the status for all diskII devices. (it's that old slots[8][2] array again..) and that is registered mailbox also. Or there is a routine in the diskII code that whenever we update motor on we update that global.. or the first disk device that starts, creates the record, and registers it, which contains data for all slots. Is this ick? or genius?

Also: new concept for Device Debug callbacks. when debugger window is open, and certain device types are selected, we will display useful diagnostic info; e.g. mockingboard registers; disk ii track no and head position; that sort of thing. Then each module is responsible for its own debug info! Snazz.

All the mount/unmount stuff is kind of fugly too. Sigh. One thing at a time. But.. ooh.. we could do the cassette device this way. Hmm. CiderPress can import WAVs to a disk image. Perhaps I could use the CiderPress code. When they 'load' the cassette, feed the audio data into CiderPress, get the binary data out (even if we have to do it in batch) and can play the WAV also out through the mac speaker.

ok, cool. nobody's gonna do this but it will be there for completeness (and maybe an apple I mode..)
