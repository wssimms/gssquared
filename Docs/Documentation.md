## Keyboard

### Apple II+

1. control keys: YES
1. shift keys: YES
1. arrow keys: YES. II+ only has left and right arrow keys.
1. Escape key: YES
1. RESET key: YES. Map Control+F10 to this.
1. EXIT key: YES. Map F12 to this.
1. REPT key: no. But we don't need this, autorepeat driven by real keyboard.
1. Backspace - YES. This apparently maps to same as back arrow. Got lucky.

## Display

The display is managed by the cross-platform SDL3 library, which supports graphics
but also sound, user input, lots of other stuff. It is a library intended for
video games, and in thinking about all the things that make up a good emulator, 
emulators fit the video game category quite closely.

GSSquared supports three video display engines:
* NTSC - a highly accurate rendering of Apple II video as it would have worked on a composite monitor of the time.
* RGB - a more typical "emulator" rendering of video.
* Monochrome - green, amber, or white high bandwidth monochrome display.

At this time all video modes below work with all display engines.

### Text Mode

Text mode is complete. It supports 40-column normal, inverse, and flash.

### Low-Resolution Graphics

Low-resolution graphics are complete. They work with screen 1, 2, split-screen, and full-screen.

### High-Resolution Graphics

Works with page 1, 2, split-screen, and full-screen.

## Disk Drive Interfaces

### Disk II Controller Card Design and Operation

https://www.bigmessowires.com/2021/11/12/the-amazing-disk-ii-controller-card/

We simulate time passage by counting cycles, not by counting realtime. This way floppy disks can be simulated at any speed. If you are running in one of the faster modes, the simulated disk drive "speeds up".

We support reading and writing to Disk II images per the table above. Writes are buffered in memory until you unmount the disk, at which time if there have been changes you are given the opportunity to save them back to the original image file.

### RAMfast SCSI Interface

I'm not sure if there is any benefit to emulating the RAMfast SCSI interface. An Apple II forum
user suggested it, but, I don't think there was any software that required it specifically?
(There was also a suggestion to emulate a SecondSight, and, that would be way easier and
make more sense).

### Pascal Storage Device

There is a standardized device interface that ProDOS supports, called Pascal. This may be what
became known as the SmartPort / ProDOS block-device interface. See above.


# Using GSSquared

## Mouse Capture

If you click inside the window, the mouse will be "captured". This is important for Mouse-based Joystick emulation, and later for supporting a Mouse card.

To release the mouse, you can hit F1, or Alt-Tab to switch windows. (Alt-Tab may be a bit different depending on your host operating system.)

Mouse capture also turns off the "mouse movement shows OSD controls" feature. It locks you into that keyboard-oriented Apple II experience.

## On-Screen Display (OSD)

This is the "Control Panel" of the system.

To open, press F4 or click the Triangle tab that appears near the upper left corner of the display when the mouse is moving.

## Reset

Apple II reset is Control-F10; or, press the RESET button in the OSD.

You can Control-Alt-Reset to simulate a IIe style "force reboot" even on a II+. (This clears the reset vector to 0's to trigger a monitor ROM autostart).

## Mounting Disks

Mounting disks into the Emulator is hopefully simple!

1. Open the OSD.
1. Click a disk drive.
1. Select a disk image.
1. Close the OSD.

Drive-specific details:

* 3.5" Drives

You can mount any 800K or bigger disk image file onto the 3.5 drives, including hard drive images, up to 32MB. Changes to these images are written immediately.

* 5.25" Drives

You can mount any exactly 143K (140K) disk image to a 5.25" drive. Changes written to these drives are held in memory until you unmount them. At that time the system will ask if you want to save changes back to the original disk image file.

## Display Configuration

In the OSD, there are buttons to change the display engine - NTSC, RGB, and Monochrome. And, buttons to change the Monochrome color (green, amber, white).

Pressing F2 cycles through the display engines.  
Pressing F5 toggles between pixel-blur and rectangular. pixel-blur provides a little more "analog" upscaling of Apple II dots to modern displays. Rectangular performs an exact square upscaling/downscaling.

These are matters of personal preference, so you get to pick the one you like best.


# Code Organization

## Frames

The system is organized around Frames, and an event loop. You can think of a frame as a video update cycle, occuring 60 times per second.

This is basically modern video game development organization.

The main system loop does the following:

* execute 1/60th of a second's worth of CPU instructions, based on current "speed" setting.
* process events (keyboard, mouse inputs, etc)
* generate audio frames
* generate video update
* sleep precisely until start of next frame

CPU instructions are emulated at the equivalent of 500 times faster than the original Apple II, which leaves plenty of time in that 1/60th second to do all the other work above. This allows the overall cycle rate to be very accurately timed as far as human perception goes.

And that's the core of this design - organized around frames like this, the code is executing very differently to how it was in a real II, but the way we perceive it is indistinguishable.

This organization also makes the system very portable, and, very accommodating to host systems of different speeds.

## Platforms

When a virtual Apple II is created and 'powered on', there are several stages.

1. Platform is initialized.
1. CPU structure is created.
1. MMU is created
1. Memory allocated and initial memory map assigned.
1. Devices are initialized and 'registered'.
1. The CPU is 'powered on'.

A "Platform" is a specific selection and combination of: CPU type, devices, and memory map.
Because so much of the Apple II series share significant systems and subsystems,
we define and implement those with granularity and "compose" them together when a 
particular virtual machine is set up.

As one example, the Apple II, II+, IIe, IIc, and IIgs all share the same $C030 primitive
speaker toggle. So, we write that only once. When we 'boot' a IIgs OR a IIe, we call
"init_mb_speaker" against the Computer structure, and that hooks in this functionality using memory mapping routines in the MMU.

Similarly with CPUs. You want a IIe with nmos 6502? Great. Select those components.
You want a IIe with original firmware but 65c02 (it might not run very well but try it anyway!) You can define a platform to do exactly that.

Want to create your own platform that never existed in reality and experiment?
Go for it! Design the next generation of Apple II! Then maybe someone can take your
idea and implement in hardware.

Contribute new devices back to the project for fun and profit! Well, for fun anyway.

## Computer

The "Computer" serves as a nexus and container for the various components of the system - the CPU, MMU, Devices, VideoSystem, and AudioSystem.

## CPU

The CPU is the central processing unit, executing 6502/816 instructions.

## MMU

The MMU manages memory for the system, including allocating main system memory, and performing memory mapping at the request of devices.

Memory is mapped in units of Pages. In the Apple II/II+/IIe world, a page is 256 bytes as this is typically the smallest unit of memory mapping.

A page has 5 map controls:
* Read memory - maps reads for the page to a certain memory block inside the emulator
* Write memory - maps writes to a memory block
* Read Handler Callback - maps reads to a callback handler
* Write Handler Callback - maps writes to a callback handler
* Shadow Callback - maps writes to a SECOND callback handler if desired.

As an example, the Shadow callback function is used by the display system to be notified whenever a byte in video memory (text, or hires) is modified - this sets flags to update that part of the display. (An optimization, we don't redraw the entire screen every frame, only those areas changed).

The page C000-C0FF is further broken down into 256 Softswitch locations. When a device initializes, it registers a read and/or write handler on I/O locations it wants to control.

There is also a special callback handler for managing C800-C8FF memory space by a device.

Whenever the MMU is asked to read or write a memory address, it looks up the page map entry for the page in question and handles according to programmed map controls.

## VideoSystem

The VideoSystem mediates video updates between display modules (e.g. motherboard video or Videx) and the underlying SDL. Typically, a display system will maintain a texture in the host video RAM. When frame update is complete, VideoSystem completes the frame by drawing the texture into the display window.

## Devices

Devices are components of an emulated system aside from the above ones. There are two categories: motherboard devices, and slot devices. A slot device is one which would go into an expansion slot in a real Apple II (Disk II, Videx, Memory Expansion Card, Language Card). A motherboard device is one that is typically embedded on the motherboard (e.g., keyboard, game port).

Users will be able to edit the Slot Cards in a system, and you can have multiple instances of a slot device in a system. For example: you can put two Mockingboards into a system though I am unaware of any software besides Ultima V that acutally uses it. Or two Disk II controllers for four Disk II drives.

You can only have one instance of each type of motherboard device in a system, and these are not user-changeable. These are defined in code as part of the "Platform" data structures.

When a device initializes it hooks into the system by setting callbacks for its I/O locations in the MMU. It may also hook in callbacks for C800, shadow memory, etc. Whatever it needs.

Devices may also register a "frame handler" which is called once per video frame.
