/**
 * Each audio frame is for 17000 samples per frame (1020500 samples/second, 1/60th second)
 * These are first downsampled (close to integer) by passing through a low pass filter,
 * and adding each cycle's contribution to the sample.
 * then, output samples are passed through a second low pass filter to remove high frequency noise.
 * We set an audio stream with SDL to be 1700 samples per frame (102000 samples/second),
 * so that our downsampling is close to integer. Otherwise we get significant artifacts because
 * we'd have fractional cycles we're not counting.
 * We keep track of the cycle counter. So an audio frame has a
 * start cycle counter and an end cycle counter.
 * 
 * Keep a circular buffer of 32000 events.
