/** make the 'font' - i.e a predefined mapping of hires input bytes to pixel data
 * The first half of the 'font' covers 256 byte values 
 * The 2nd half covers 256 byte values if the previous byte was delayed - we draw an extra 1 bit.
 * These tables convert the 7 bits of hires input into 14 bits of "display" data. Bits are doubled
 * in order to map to the actual screen clock (2x the number of pixels) and to allow us to shift
 * the bits to the right to account for the delay (if the hi-bit of a byte is set, all the bits in that
 * are delayed by one 14M cycle.)
 * Essentially we create a signal clocked at 14M. This is required to get the right bits for simulating
 * various composite quirks in the Apple II design.
