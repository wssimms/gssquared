# GSSquared - A Complete Apple II Series Emulator.

GSSquared is a complete emulator for the Apple II series of computers. It is written in C++ and runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

It uses the SDL3 library for graphics, sound, and I/O. This is a video game-oriented library and suits an emulator well. And, it's cross-platform.

The code base builds and has been tested on:
* MacBook Pro M1
* Mac Intel
* Mac Mini M4
* Ubuntu Linux 22.04 (x64 AMD)

I am hoping I can get someone else to build on Windows. :-)

# Download Binary

A binary release is available at [https://github.com/jawaidbazyar2/gssquared/releases](https://github.com/jawaidbazyar2/gssquared/releases).

# Building

General Build Instructions:

To build GSSquared, you will need the following:
* clang C compiler or GCC
* SDL3 downloaded and built from the SDL web site. (Specific steps for this are below.)
* git

I use vscode as my IDE, but, this isn't required to build.

Note that GSSquared tries to force-select Clang as the compiler. If you want to override that you can edit the top of the CMakeLists and remove the clang-selection logic.

NOTE: the build process has been updated so that builds are done in and to the build/ directory, as opposed to prior versions of GS2 where builds were done into the project root directory.

GSSquared should also build with GCC on Ubuntu 22.04 or later, but this hasn't been tested.


## Build for Production

Production builds are optimized for performance.

```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -S . -B build
```

## Build for Debug

Debug enables a variety of assertions, turns off optimizations, and enables memory leak and buffer overrun checking.

```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -S . -B build
```

## macOS

GSSquared will build on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.

You will need:
* Mac OSX 15 SDK, either Command-line or full Xcode.

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jawaidbazyar2/gssquared.git
cd gssquared
```

If you just want to do a standard build that will result in a Mac App Bundle,

```
cmake -DGS2_PROGRAM_FILES=OFF  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -S . -B build
cmake --build build
cmake --install build
```

This will "install" an App Bundle into the build/ directory, named GSSquared.app. (Or in Finder, just GSSquared)

### Mac DMG Disk Image

To go further and build a Mac Disk Image (.dmg file), do this from project root after doing the above build,

```
cmake --build build --target package
```

The app bundle and .dmg file are built into the packages/ directory.

### Mac PROGRAM FILES Mode

PROGRAM FILES Mode will just build executable into build/ (named GSSquared) suitable for execution from the command-line.

```
cmake -DGS2_PROGRAM_FILES=ON  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -S . -B build
cmake --build build
build/GSSquared
```

You may also use -DCMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Debug , which will disable optimizations, and include debugger symbols in the result.

### Mac Architecture

By default, GSSquared builds as a "Fat Binary" or Dual-Architecture binary for both Apple Silicon and Intel CPUs.

If for some reason you want to build only for your native architecture:

```
cmake -DBUILD_NATIVE=ON  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -S . -B build
```


## Linux

gs2 Linux build has been tested on:

* Ubuntu 22.04
* clang 14

You need the following libraries installed:
* libasound2-dev
* libpulse-dev
* libudev-dev

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jawaidbazyar2/gssquared.git
cd gssquared
```

Then to build:

```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

Alternatively, build in the "GNU install directories" style:
```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DGS2_PROGRAM_FILES=OFF -S . -B build
cmake --build build
cmake --install build
```
Now you should be able to run gs2 at command line anywhere via a `GSSquared`
command, and it should also be available as an application from your
applications list.

### Linux App Distribution

After building, you can create a folder that contains a complete package for Linux:

```
cmake --build build --target package
```

Creates a .TGZ package in the build/ directory that contains all the pieces you need.

## Windows

We've successfully built for windows using the following environment:

* mingw
* VS Code
* clang

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jawaidbazyar2/gssquared.git
cd gssquared
mkdir build
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -B build -S .
mingw32-make.exe
```

### Windows App Distribution

After building, you can create a folder that contains libraries and assets for Windows.

```
mingw32-make.exe packages
```


## Creating Distribution Packages

```
cmake --build build --target packages
```

This will create a 'packages' directory with the following structure:

```
packages/
├── linux-cli/
├── mac-cli/
├── GSSquared.dmg
├── GSSquared.app/
```

The mac-package and mac-cli-package are the same, but the mac-cli-package is used to create a DMG file for the macOS app bundle.

Only the appropriate package types for the platform you're building on will be created.

"make", "make all", "make mac-dev" or "make linux-dev" will create a resources directory in the build tree, for local testing.

# Documentation

Check out the [KeyboardShortcuts.md](Docs/KeyboardShortcuts.md) file for a list of keyboard shortcuts needed to operate.

# Affiliated Programs

If you build from source, you will also get a couple of other programs:

## diskid

Analyzes a disk image and prints information about it.

## nibblizer

Convert a disk image file (140K 5.25 .do, .po, .dsk) to nibblized format (e.g. .nib). For testing. 

## gstrace

I also shamelessly copied the Disk II sound files from OpenEmulator.

## Mike Neil
